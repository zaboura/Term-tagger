The total solar eclipse that will happen August 21, 2017, will dazzle everyone who views it. Potential observers may have some questions, however. Where in the United States does totality happen? That\'92s easy to answer with a detailed map. Where are the best spots to view the event? That isn\'92t as straightforward.\
Except for knowing that you want to be on, or at least near, the eclipse\'92s center line \'97 where totality will last the longest \'97 what makes for a good viewing location? Here are 20 sites you should consider, starting in the Northwest and working to the Southeast.\
I do offer one suggestion when choosing a site: Carefully consider the population. All things being equal, a town of 10,000 is much more likely to have event-related problems than a city of 75,000. Traffic will be one of the primary issues. Small communities with one main road may suffer hours of gridlock. If you choose to head to such a location, get there early, perhaps even a day or two ahead of the eclipse. Remember: August 21, 2017, is a Monday. So the whole weekend beforehand will be free for most people.\
