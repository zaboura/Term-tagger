T. Buick and P. Pugh, How to Photograph the Moon and Planets with Your Digital Camera, Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-5828-0, © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 Binoculars For those aspiring astrophotographers who are hesitant to purchase a telescope mention was made of a DIY platform to support a camera to capture images through binoculars. The few illustrations given here should enable one to be constructed from easily obtainable parts, as shown in Figs. A.1 and A.2. The platform is a piece of tongue and groove floorboard wood 30 × 15 cm. Saw it in two approximately 12 cm from one end (Fig. A.3). This part takes the camera. Add a door bolt to serve as a safety device to prevent accidental tipping of the camera support shown in Fig. A.4. Drill holes to take appropriate threaded bolts to secure the camera on one section and binocular clamp on the other. The clamp must have a screw thread to allow attachment to a camera tripod. Affix two hinges to join the two sections together as shown in Fig. A.5. A pencil of hexagonal cross-section pushed into the groove locks the two sections together firmly. When the camera section is hinged down it is possible to view the sky object for focusing. Appendix 307 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Fig. A.1. Binocular mounting platform. Fig. A.2.

For Further Progress Here are some tips about how to move forward in your hobby: Do join your local astronomical society. It is the greatest source of infor-mation as well as providing much support, encouragement and social enjoyment with like-minded people. Do read your telescope and camera manual. Do attend astronomy exhibitions and shows to keep abreast of what is available and to look out for bargains. Do experiment with equipment and conditions to produce even better pictures. Do read the astronomy forums.

Accessories include eyepieces, image amplifiers, and focal reducers. There are all sorts of filters (q.v.) as well. Achromat See achromatic refractor (q.v.). Achromatic refractor Normal type of refractor seen in stores. It uses an objective lens made of two types of glass (crown and flint) to reduce chromatic aberration inherent in telescope lenses. Active region General term used by the research community to denote a region of the Sun containing active sunspots and associated features. Each active region has a serial number and is denoted ARxxxx, where xxxx is the serial number. Actual field of view Diameter of the area of sky that you can see through a telescope or binoc-ulars it is measured in degrees and/or arcminutes. It is obtained by divid-ing the apparent field of view (q.v.) of an eyepiece by the magnification. Glossary 313 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Afocal adaptor Afocal photography is also known as "eyepiece projection" and is the act of taking a photograph through a telescope using an eyepiece. An adaptor allows the camera to be held near the eyepiece to reduce camera shake. Afocal coupling Act of taking photographs through a telescope eyepiece. Afocal photography See afocal coupling. Afocal projection See afocal coupling. Albedo Proportion of light falling on a non-luminous body that is reflected from it. The Moon's albedo is 7%. Albireo Double star in the constellation of Cygnus, which is a true binary system. Its separation is wide enough to be resolved in modest binoculars. It is well known because of the orange/blue-green color contrast. Alcor Star that forms part of a wide optical double star with Mizar (q.v.) in the Big Dipper (or Plough), which is part of Ursa Major. Aldebaran Brightest star in the constellation of Taurus and is a distinct red/orange color. There is some debate as to whether it is variable or not. Alpha Centauri Double star system in the constellation of Centaurus. As it is near the south celestial pole, it cannot be seen from the Europe or the United States. Its components can be split in a small telescope. The larger of the two is very similar to the Sun but slightly bigger and brighter, and the smaller of the two is slightly smaller and fainter. There is a third member of the system, Proxima Centauri (q.v.), which is actually the true nearest star to us apart from the Sun. Andromeda Constellation in the northern hemisphere, which is home to the famous Andromeda Galaxy (q.v.). 314 Glossary Andromeda galaxy Galaxy often mentioned in science fiction. It is the nearest large galaxy to our own Milky Way and is the largest natural object readily visible in the sky from the northern hemisphere. It can be seen with the unaided eye on a good night from a dark location but normally needs binoculars. Angström/angström unit Used to measure the wavelengths of light and other very small distances. It is a meter divided by ten times and is a tenth of a nanometer. It is abbreviated to A. It is often quoted in relation to solar astronomy. Annular solar eclipse Solar eclipse that would be total, except that the relative distances of the Sun and Moon mean that the lunar disc is not quite large enough to cover the solar disc, so a ring, or annulus, around the Moon is seen. Antares Name given to a red giant star in the constellation of Scorpius (Scorpio). It is also used as the brand name of a series of accessories (q.v.). APO/apochromat See apochromatic refractor (q.v.). Apochromatic refractor Improvement on the achromatic refractor (q.v.). It uses three types of glass to just about eliminate chromatic aberration entirely. Care must be taken to ensure that a telescope marketed as apochromatic is not extra dispersion (ED) or semi-apochromatic (although these types of refractor are still better than an achromat). Also, there are several types of apochro-matic telescopes, so you need to be careful before you buy, especially if the manufacturer does not have an established track record. Apogee Furthest point in an elliptical orbit from the center of Earth. Apparent field of view Measure of the width of the field of view of an eyepiece. It is the theoreti-cal field of view that would be obtained if you were able to use a magni-fication of 1×. To get the "real," or actual field of view, (q.v.) for a given telescope/eyepiece combination, you need to divide the apparent field of view by the magnification. Whereas most eyepiece types have an appar-ent field of view of 52°, this can vary. 315 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Ashen light Effect seen on Venus where the dark side is lit by light scattered through the Venusian atmosphere. Asterism Name given to a pattern of stars that is part of a constellation, rather than being a constellation in its own right. The most famous one is the Big Dipper or Plough. Asteroid Just like until recently we thought we knew what a planet was, we are now in doubt as to what constitutes an asteroid. Well, the short answer is that it isn't big enough to be a dwarf planet, so that means that Vesta is still an asteroid, while Ceres is not. Oh, yes, to fully complete the picture, if an "asteroid" is in orbit around a planet or a dwarf planet, then it is really a moon. Astigmatism Type of defect in optical equipment where objects near the edge of the field of view become distorted. It is most common in binoculars. AVI Also known by its full name of audio visual interleave. It is a commonly used file format for capturing video and is often used as the output from webcams. Baader filter Type of "white light" filter that reduces the amount of light reaching the eye used for solar astronomy. Filters can be bought readymade or the material can be purchased in the form of sheets, which can be made into filters. Note that different thicknesses can be used for visual and photo-graphic applications. Bandpass When using a filter, light slightly longer or shorter than the required wavelength is allowed to pass through. The range of wavelengths allowed is known as the bandpass and is measured in angström units. A narrow bandpass is required for solar astronomy. Wider bandpasses are used for night time astronomy. Barycenter Center of mass of a system of two bodies. The barycenter of Earth-Moon system lies 1,707 km below Earth's surface. 316 Glossary Bayer filter mosaic Color filter array (CFA) for arranging RGB color filters on a square grid of photosensors. The term derives from the name of its inventor, Bryce Bayer of Eastman Kodak, and refers to a particular arrangement of color filters used in most single-chip digital cameras. Bryce Bayer's patent called the green photosensors luminance-sensitive elements and the red and blue ones chrominance-sensitive elements. He used twice as many green elements as red or blue to mimic the human eye's greater resolving power with green light. These elements are referred to as samples and after interpolation become pixels. The raw output of Bayer filter cameras is referred to as a Bayer pattern image. Since each pixel is filtered to record only one of the three colors, two-thirds of the color data is missing from each. A demosaicing algorithm is used to interpolate a set of complete red, green, and blue values for each point, to make an RGB image. Many different algorithms exist. Beehive Star cluster (q.v.) found in the constellation of Cancer and an easy target for small binoculars. Big Dipper Not a true constellation as such but is the most prominent pattern of stars (or asterism) within the constellation of Ursa Major (q.v.). It is known as the Plough in the United Kingdom. Binary system Pair of stars that orbit around their common center of gravity (or bary-center (q.v.)). BK-7 Type of glass used for the construction of achromatic lenses and binocu-lar prisms. Black drop effect Seen when an inferior planet transits the Sun, and its silhouette appears to remain attached to the solar limb for a while. Blocking filter Secondary filter placed in a light path of a solar telescope to reduce the amount of light reaching the eyepiece. Broadband Name used to describe a filter that allows a large bandpass (q.v.). Broadband filters are unsuitable for solar hydrogen alpha or calcium K viewing. 317 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Brocchi's cluster Alternative name for the Coathanger (q.v.). Brown dwarf Object composed of the same material as stars but too small for nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium to begin. They cannot be seen except through very large telescopes. CaK/calcium K Emission line in the Sun from a layer about 2,000 km above the solar surface associated with ionized calcium. It is sensitive to magnetic fields and has a wavelength of 3,934 Å units and is towards the blue/violet end of the spectrum. Not all people are sensitive to it. California nebula Nebula in Perseus. Although its integrated magnitude is quite bright, it is hard to see or photograph because its brightness is spread out over a large area. Camelopardalis This is a faint far northern constellation, said to represent a giraffe. It is home to Kemble's Cascade (q.v.). Canals Features apparently seen on the surface of Mars that once suggested that they were built by intelligent beings to transport water around the planet. Cancer Constellation on the ecliptic, so it forms part of the Zodiac. As well as being a temporary home to many Solar System objects, it also contains the Beehive, one of many astronomers' favorite star clusters. Catalog List of deep sky objects. There are several well-known ones. The most famous is the Messier Catalog, created by Charles Messier and his col-league, Pierre Mechain. Celestial sphere Imaginary sphere of indefinite size surrounding Earth with Earth at the center. Cell structure The solar "surface" appears smooth in "white light" views using small instruments, but, in reality, it consists of "bubbles" or cells of hot gas, mostly hydrogen. This structure is visible in white light at high magnification. 318 Glossary Centaurus Constellation (q.v.) of which only a small part can be seen from the United States or Europe. It contains a lot of interesting objects, most of them too far south. Chromatic aberration Undesirable property of many telescopes and accessories that causes light of different wavelengths to come to different focal points and cause color fringes in the image. This is not a problem with narrowband solar viewing, as the light is all of the same wavelength (monochrome light, see later). Chromosphere Layer of the Sun where the photosphere (layer of the Sun visible in "white light") meets the solar corona. It is where the hydrogen alpha and cal-cium K emission lines originate. Coathanger Asterism in the constellation of Vulpecula. Collimation Act of aligning the primary mirror of a reflector so that objects appear at a sharp focus. Collinder Name given to a particular list, or catalog, of deep sky objects, similar in nature to Messier's list of objects. Collinder 39 Alternative name for Melotte 20 (q.v.). Collinder 399 Alternative name for the Coathanger (q.v.). Coma (1) Part of a comet that forms when the comet comes near the Sun, usu-ally within the orbit of Mars, that causes it to brighten and (hopefully) become visible to amateur instruments. (2) Type of optical distortion. Comet A comet differs from an asteroid (or dwarf planet) in physical com-position. Many objects in the outer Solar System (probably the huge majority) are comets, and there is even speculation that Pluto is a giant comet! 319 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Constellation Pattern of stars taken by people in the past to represent some object, animate or not. Every star is regarded as part of one of the many constel-lations. The convention is still used today, as it helps astronomers find their way around the sky. Corona Part of the solar atmosphere that surrounds the Sun normally only vis-ible at a total solar eclipse. Coronal mass ejection Stream of charged particles that are ejected from the solar corona into the Solar System. When they meet Earth and other planets with atmospheres, auroras are seen, sometimes at temperate latitudes, although more usu-ally in polar regions only. Corrector plate Glass plate used over the tube of a reflector to eliminate the effects of spherical aberration (q.v.). Cygnus Constellation thought to represent the pattern of a swan, although its alternative description of the Northern Cross is perhaps more apt. It is home to many interesting objects and the Milky Way passes through it, making it a nice place to just casually browse through binoculars. Dark frame Photograph taken with a digital camera with an obstruction placed over it. It captures any "hot pixels," i.e., pixels that show light even when no picture is being taken. This dark frame can then be subtracted from a photograph of an object to reduce the "noise." Dark nebula Objects that neither emit nor reflect light but have a similar composition to emission nebulae (q.v.) and reflection nebulae (q.v.). Dawes limit Theoretical resolution limit for a telescope, normally calculated by divid-ing the aperture in millimeters into 116 to get the answer in arcseconds. As an example, a 114 mm Newtonian reflector has a Dawes limit of just over an arcsecond. In practice the Dawes limit is rarely reached. To get anywhere near it, you need a clear sky, perfect optics, and a magnification of at least twice the telescope's aperture in millimeters. Yes, and a lucky charm is helpful as well! 320 Glossary Declination Equivalent of Earth's latitude superimposed on the sky. Telescopes are manually or motor driven to follow latitude movement – the height above the observer's horizon. A clamp is provided to hold a particular setting during viewing. Dedicated solar telescope Telescope that has been designed exclusively for narrowband solar view-ing and photography, predominantly hydrogen alpha and calcium K. At the budget end of the market, dedicated telescopes are usually cheaper than separate filter systems, but the balance swings the other way at the top end of the market. Delta Lyrae Double star in the constellation of Lyra. Diffraction spikes Occurs where the appearance of a star is changed by lines appearing to emanate from it. They are caused by the "spider" supporting the second-ary mirror in a Newtonian reflector. Double stacking Act of adding another filter to further reduce the bandpass of a telescope or filter used for narrowband solar viewing. Double star/double star system Pair of stars, orbiting around their common center of gravity, or baryc-enter (q.v.). If the stars are very unequal in mass, the smaller (secondary) component of the system will appear to orbit around the larger (pri-mary) component, as the center of gravity lies inside the body of the primary component. This is often referred to as a binary system. Another type of double star is the optical double, where the stars are not physi-cally related but happen to lie along the same line of sight, as seen from Earth. Draco This is a far northern constellation that is home to a couple of bright double stars and a planetary nebula. Dumbbell Brightest example of a planetary nebula (q.v.) and can sometimes be seen in quite modest instruments. 321 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Earthshine This is the reflection of light from the Earth lightening the unlit side of the Moon. It is usually visible during the waxing and waning crescent phases of the lunar cycle. Ecliptic Path around the background sky that the Sun traces out as a result of Earth's orbit. ED See extra dispersion (q.v.). Ejecta Material propelled outwards from an explosive event such as that pro-duced by bombardment of the Moon to form craters. Elongation Apparent distance of an object from the Sun as seen from Earth, meas-ured in degrees. Any object less than about 15° elongation from the Sun cannot be viewed in a dark sky. Furthermore, the angle between the object and the Sun at sunset (and, hence, its elevation above the horizon) may require an elongation of more than 30° to be seen clearly. Elongation is of particular interest to viewers of the inferior planets (q.v.). Energy rejection filter Broadband filter used to block infrared and ultraviolet light, with the intention of preventing damage to equipment or human eyesight. It is usually associated with narrowband solar viewing. Epsilon Lyrae Double star in the constellation of Lyra, which can be split using binocu-lars. Each component is also a double star in its own right but needs a reasonable telescope and good conditions to split. It is therefore known as the "Double Double." Etalon Narrowband filter used to allow only light very close to a specific wave-length to pass through. Typically used for hydrogen alpha light and calcium K light viewing. Also known as the Fabry-Perot etalon. Exit pupil Width of the light beam leaving the telescope or binocular eyepiece. It is derived by dividing the aperture by the magnification. If it matches the aperture of the observer's pupil, the results are good, and objects appear bright. If it exceeds it, there is some light loss, and the object appears 322 Glossary dimmer. Young observers may have a pupil as wide as 8 mm in complete darkness, but this reduces to around 5–6 mm for middle-aged observers at suburban locations. Looking at bright lights can seriously reduce your pupil width. Extra dispersion lens Variation on the achromatic objective lens, which uses extra dispersion flint glass to improve the performance. Extinction Dimming effect caused when an object is near the horizon. As it has to pass through more of Earth's atmosphere, more of its light is absorbed, so it is much dimmer when it meets the eye, binoculars, telescope, or camera. Eyepiece Lens or combination of lenses used to magnify the image formed by the telescope. The higher the number (which identifies the focal length) the lower the magnification. A 25 mm eyepiece produces a larger image than a 40 mm. Barlow lenses are added to the eyepiece to multiply the magni-fication by, typically, two or three – hence ×2 or ×3 Barlow lens. Fabry-perot etalon See etalon. Facula (pl., faculae) Brighter region of the solar surface usually associated with a sunspot region. Filter Device used to allow light of only certain wavelengths to pass through. There are full aperture filters (q.v.) and those placed at the eyepiece end of a telescope. They can be broadband (q.v.) or narrowband (q.v.). Flare Exceptionally bright region of the Sun, often a precursor to a coronal mass ejection (see earlier). Flat frame Picture of a white background used to capture any unevenness in the light captured in a photograph. When a picture of an astronomical object is taken, the unevenness can be removed by dividing by the flat frame. To be most accurate, a dark frame (q.v.) should be subtracted from the flat frame. Focal reducer This is the exact opposite of an image amplifier (q.v.). 323 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Full aperture filter Filter placed at the objective end of the telescope in order to reduce the light coming in. Narrowband full aperture filters are the most effective means of solar viewing but can be expensive in the larger sizes. Baader filters for white light viewing reduce the amount of light but do not restrict the wavelengths of light coming through. Another type is energy rejection filters (q.v.). Galilean moons These are the moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo. They are Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, and Io. GEM Abbreviation for German equatorial mount (q.v.). German equatorial mount Commonly used design of an equatorial mount that includes coarse and fine controls used to find and track objects. Despite the name, most of them are made in China. Ghost crater Heavily eroded or submerged crater such that only a small portion can be seen above the surrounding landscape. Ghosting Side effect of some types of eyepiece design where a faint secondary image of an object is also produced. Globular cluster Star cluster whose members are concentrated in a small area. To the unaided eye or small instruments they are hard to distinguish from small galaxies, but a larger instrument may resolve outer members into indi-vidual stars. Granularity Property of the solar surface (photosphere and chromosphere) to appear like grains. This is caused by the presence of pockets of hydrogen emanat-ing from deeper levels of the Sun. Great red spot Atmospheric feature on Jupiter that has been around since before the invention of the telescope. 324 Glossary H alpha/hydrogen alpha Emission line in the Sun from a layer about 1,700 km above the solar surface that is associated with neutral hydrogen. It has a wavelength of 6,563 Å units and is towards the red end of the spectrum. Hale-Bopp Bright comet that was visible in 1997. Halley's Comet Periodic comet that returns to the inner Solar System about every 77 years. Hyades Star cluster in the constellation of Taurus. Image amplifier General term for a telescope accessory that boosts the magnification of any given eyepiece. The most common type is the Barlow lens. Inferior conjunction Point in the path of an inferior planet around the Sun, as seen from Earth, where it is between the Sun and Earth. As both inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) have orbits inclined to the ecliptic, they will usually pass above or below the Sun, as seen from Earth. Both planets are capable of crossing the solar disc on rare occasions, and this event is known as a transit (q.v.). Inferior planet General term that refers to a planet whose orbit is wholly contained within Earth's orbit. Mercury and Venus are the inferior planets. Inner Solar System Term often used but has no official definition. It is best thought of as the part of the Solar System where comets form noticeable tails and is around the orbit of Mars. ISO rating Measure of the sensitivity to light of the camera, represented by a number – the higher the number, the greater the sensitivity. ISO stands for International Standards Organization. JPEG File format used to record digital images on most types of cameras. It is good for not using too much space, but some fine detail is often lost in compression. 325 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Kellner Type of eyepiece not commonly used but supplied with the Coronado™ PST. Libration North/south and east/west "rocking" of the face of the Moon towards us, caused by its orbit's elliptical nature and inclination to the ecliptic. The main directions of libration are up-down and sideways, which allow viewing of slightly more than 50% (in fact 59%) of the Moon's surface over a period of time. Long eye relief (LER) Type of eyepiece that allows the image to be viewed a further distance than other designs. These are particularly useful for eyeglass wearers and are suited to photography. Lux value Amount of visible light per square meter incident on a surface. 1 lux = 1 lumen/square meter = 0.093 foot-candles. Lyra Northern constellation thought to represent the pattern of a lyre (type of musical instrument). Despite its small size, it is home to many interesting objects, and the Milky Way passes through it. M The letter "M" itself is usually followed by a number, indicating that it is an object in the Messier catalog. Magnetic field (solar) The solar magnetic field is believed to be the main cause of all the inter-esting features that we see on the Sun, whether in white light or using narrowband filters. Maksutov-Cassegrain Type of reflecting telescope designed to reduce chromatic aberration and produce high-quality images. Maria (sing., mare) Latin for "seas," as these dark lunar features were once thought to contain water, like the seas on Earth. We now know that they are ancient lava flows that occurred when the Moon was still volcanically active. Melotte 111 Star cluster in the constellation of Coma Berenices. 326 Glossary Melotte 20 Star cluster in the constellation of Perseus, around its brightest star, Alpha Persei. Messier, Charles Comet hunter in France during the 1800s. However, he is better known for his "catalog" of deep sky objects that could potentially be confused with comets. His catalog is actually a useful list of objects that are worth looking at. Meteor Visual image, or flash, formed by an object burning up in Earth's atmos-phere. Minus violet filter Filter that blocks the far end of the visible light spectrum. It is used because many telescopes, especially short focal length achromatic refractors, do not bring wavelength of this light to the same focus as other wavelengths, such as red and green. They are sometimes called "semi-APO" filters as a marketing ploy. Mizar Star in the Big Dipper (or Plough) that forms a wide optical double star with Alcor (q.v.). It is also a binary system in its own right and can be split in a small telescope. Monochrome light Light that is of the same wavelength. The term "monochrome" as used for "black and white" television, is in fact used incorrectly. Hydrogen alpha and calcium K are examples of monochrome light. Nagler Very expensive type of eyepiece that is very, very good or maybe even better than that! Nanometer Billionth of a meter and, like the angström unit, is also used to measure very small distances, such as light wavelengths. It is commonly abbrevi-ated to "nm." There are 10 Å units in a nanometer. Narrowband Term used to describe filters with a low bandpass, which only allow light very close to a specific wavelength to pass through. Nebula Large "cloud" consisting mainly of hydrogen but also some heavier ele-ments. 327 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Neutral density Type of filter that blocks light of all wavelengths equally, reducing the light transmission but not the resolution. Newton's rings Term that sounds like something scientific and desirable but is the oppo-site, being an interference pattern that can appear when taking photo-graphs. Node See orbital node (q.v.). Northern Cross Alternative name for Cygnus (q.v.). Nova Literally means "new star," but it is really a white dwarf star that has cap-tured some material from a nearby companion and heated it to cause a runaway nuclear reaction, resulting in the brightening of the star several hundred or thousand times. Open star cluster Star cluster where most of the members can be separated clearly with or without optical aid but are close enough together to make it obvious that they are physically associated. Examples include the Hyades, Pleia-des, and Beehive. Ophiuchus Constellation on the ecliptic but not part of the zodiac, as known to astrologers. Opposition Occurs when a Solar System object is opposite the Sun in the sky and Earth is directly between the object and the Sun. It is usually the best time to observe an object. Optical double Pair of stars that appear to form a binary system (q.v.) but are simply close together visually in the sky because of a line of sight effect. Orbital node Place where the orbit of a planet, moon, or other object crosses the path of the ecliptic (q.v.). As the orbits of every space body in the Solar System are somewhat inclined to the ecliptic, each orbit has two nodes. 328 Glossary Orion Constellation quite well known even to non-astronomers. Part of it lies near the ecliptic, so it can be a temporary home for the Moon and planets. Parfocal Describes a set of accessories that have the same focusing position in a tel-escope, so they can be easily interchanged without adjusting the focus. Perigee The nearest point in an elliptical orbit from the center of Earth. Periodic comet Comet that returns to the inner Solar System at regular known intervals. Perseus Northern constellation said to represent a hero. It is home to many interesting objects. Photon Particle of light. By collecting photons from an astronomical object, we can form an image that we can look at or photograph. Photosphere Layer of the solar "surface" visible in "white light." Pixelated/pixelation Output with large, coarse-looking pixels. Using too high a resolution (pix-els smaller than the output device can produce) increases the file size and slows the printing of the image; furthermore, the device will be unable to reproduce the extra detail provided by the higher resolution image. Plage Exceptionally bright area of the solar surface. Pleiades Star cluster in the constellation of Taurus, also known as the Seven Sisters. Plossl Commonly used type of eyepiece, suitable for visual use. Plough See Big Dipper (q.v.). The Plough is the name in the United Kingdom. 329 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Post processing Act of improving digital images following capture using a tool such as Paintshop Pro™, Photoshop™ or similar. There are several techniques available for general photography, but solar imaging often requires spe-cialized use. Primary component For purposes of visual or photographic astronomy, the primary compo-nent is the more luminous of the two components in a binary system. For purposes of celestial mechanics, the primary component is the more massive. Primary mirror Mirror used to collect light in a reflector, which performs the same task as an objective lens in a refractor. Prominence Flame-like solar structure, which appears on the limb of the solar disc. Quadrature Point in an object's orbit where it forms a right angle between Earth, itself, and the Sun. For a superior planet, it will have an elongation of 90° from the Sun. Quantum efficiency Percentage of light reached and recorded by a camera. Rays Bright streaks or splash effect resulting from debris thrown out from impact craters. Reflecting telescope Telescope that uses a concave mirror to focus light. A refractor uses a lens. Retrograde motion Apparent motion across the sky of a superior planet or other object outside Earth's orbit as it approaches opposition. It is caused by Earth overtaking the planet on the inside. During this time, the planet appears to move backwards across the sky. RGB Literally "red, green, and blue." In photographic terms, a color image is composed of red, green, and blue components, and the amount of red, green, and blue in a camera pixel determines the shade of color that is 330 Glossary reproduced. Digital photography post processing (q.v.) manipulates the red, green, and blue outputs. Rille Long, narrow depression in the lunar surface. Although their exact origin is not well understood, rilles are believed to have been caused by col-lapsed lava flows and fault lines when the Moon was volcanically and tectonically active. Scorpius Also called Scorpio, this is a constellation in the southern part of the sky crossed by the Sun during late autumn. Apart from the ecliptic passing through it, it is also well known for its brightest star, Antares (q.v.) and is close to the central part of the Milky Way. Secondary component For purposes of visual or photographic astronomy, the secondary com-ponent is the less luminous of the two components in a binary system. For purposes of celestial mechanics, the secondary component is the less massive. Secondary mirror Mirror used in most types of reflector to reflect the light from the pri-mary mirror (q.v.) to the terminal light path, so that an object can be viewed through an eyepiece. Semi-apochromatic Term that can mean anything from a high-quality achromatic refractor to something quite close to a true apochromatic one. Get advice before buying. If it uses the term "ED" or "extra dispersion" (q.v.) it is quite good, and you know what you're getting, although a true apochromat is rather better. Seven Sisters See Pleiades (q.v.). Shröter effect Occurs when the apparent phase of Venus appears larger than theoretical models predict, due to light scattering through the Venusian atmosphere from the sunlit side to the dark side. Signal-to-noise ratio Ratio of the signal (actual light captured by a camera) to the noise (light that is introduced by the camera and/or the imaging process). 331 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Solar projection Technique that uses a telescope to project the Sun's image onto a card or screen so that sunspots and other white light features can be seen. Not used much now, due to the presence of special filters that allow you to see and photograph the Sun directly. Spherical aberration Optical defect introduced by the use of a primary mirror with a spherical shape. It can be corrected by various means, such as a corrector plate or using a parabolic mirror instead. Spider Support for the secondary mirror in a Newtonian reflector (q.v.). Star atlas Book or website used to locate stars and other deep sky objects. Star cluster Group of stars that are bound by gravity and appear close together in the sky as seen from Earth. Star diagonal Added to the rear of a telescope to direct the light at right angles to assist viewing. Eyepieces are placed in a star diagonal. Stationary point Point in a planet's orbit where its motion changes from normal to retro-grade or vice-versa. Sunspots Darker regions of the solar photosphere that are about 1,800° cooler than the rest of the photosphere. They are caused by solar magnetic fields. Super wide angle This is a type of eyepiece with an increased apparent field of view of 70° or more. Superior conjunction Event where an inferior planet (Mercury or Venus) is on the opposite side of the Sun to Earth. Synodic period Time taken for a planet to reach the same position relative to the Sun in its journey around the sky. It is related to the orbital mechanics of the planet and Earth. To allow for discrepancies in the orbits of the planet and Earth, its precise definition is the time between successive superior conjunctions of the planet. 332 Glossary Taurus Constellation apparently representing a bull that is on the ecliptic and is therefore part of the zodiac. Terminal light path filters Filters placed at the eyepiece end of a telescope. Although, in general, they are not as effective as full aperture filters (q.v.) for narrowband solar viewing, they provide a cheaper alternative for larger aperture use. They can also be used to lower the bandpass of full aperture filters, especially budget ones with a bandpass of 1.5 Å units. Terminator Line between the sunlit and dark portion of the Moon (or planet, etc.). TIFF File format used by some digital cameras. It produces larger file sizes than JPEG but records finer detail. Titan Largest moon of Saturn and can be seen in binoculars under good conditions. Transient lunar phenomena Events where the lunar surface appears to change for a brief period, such as a lightening or darkening of parts of the lunar landscape. Once thought to be the result of deficiencies in the telescope's optics, they have been photographed and are known to be genuine. Their cause, however, still remains a mystery. Triple star system Group of three stars that are gravitationally bound to each other. Ursa Major Constellation circumpolar from North America and many parts of Europe. It is home to the Big Dipper or Plough asterism. Usual Suspects Nickname given to a group of deep sky objects that can be seen by inex-perienced observers using modest equipment. Vulpecula Small northern constellation bordering on Cygnus (among others). It is home to the Coathanger (q.v.) and Dumbbell (M27). Webcam Abbreviated form of "web camera," which provides a high quality, low cost means of astrophotography. 333 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets White light General term for the collection of light emitted by the Sun in visible wavelengths. Yellow dwarf Type of star, of which the Sun is the closest example. The term "dwarf" is a bit of a misnomer, because there are more stars smaller than the Sun than larger. Zodiac Literally means "circle of animals." It is the set of constellations (q.v.) on the ecliptic (q.v.). However, there is a lot of confusion because the zodiac as used by astrologers is about 2,000 years out of date! This is one rea-son most astronomers are skeptical of astrology. The true zodiac contains Ophiuchus, and the planets and Moon can wander into Cetus and Orion as well. To confuse an astrologer tell him or her than you were born when the Sun was in Ophiuchus, Uranus was in Cetus, and Neptune was in Orion. 334 A Accessory, 18, 29, 50, 249, 312, 314, 318, 324, 328 Achromat, 312 Achromatic, 316 refractor, 191, 293, 312, 314, 326, 330 Active region, 312 Actual field of view, 312, 314 Adobe Photoshop™, 49, 189, 254 Afocal adaptor, 313 Afocal coupling, 313 Afocal photography, 313 Afocal projection, 313 Aggripa, 128 Airy, 101 Albategnius, 99, 101, 123, 129 Albedo, 58, 232, 313 Albireo, 297, 313 Alcor, 297, 313, 326 Aldebaran, 313 Alexander, 77 Aliacensis, 100, 101 Alpetragius, 123, 126 Alpha Centauri, 5, 313 Alpha Persei cluster, 293 Alphonsus, 120, 123, 162 Alpine mountains, 76, 117 Ammonius, 122 Anaxagoras, 115 Ancient Newton, 89, 111, 112 Andromeda, 313 Andromeda Galaxy, 202, 313, 314 Angström, 92 Angström unit, 314, 315, 317, 324, 326, 332 Annular eclipse, 156, 246 Annular solar eclipse, 314 Annulus, 314 Antares, 314, 330 Anville, 81 Apennines, 64 Aperture, 12, 45, 158, 206, 249, 319, 321, 332 Apianus, 100, 101 APO, 314 Apochromat, 314, 330 Apochromatic, 314 refractor, 314 telescope, 314 Apogee, 59 Apollo, 82 Apollo 11, 84 Apollo 15, 126 Apparent diameter, 280 Apparent field of view, 312, 314, 331 Aquarius, 207 Aquila, 295 Arago, 84, 130, 172 alpha, 84 beta, 84 Index 335 How to Photograph the Moon and Planets Archimedes, 86, 89, 164 Archytas, 116 Arcminute, 312 Argelander, 101 Ariadaeus, 126 Aristarchus, 92, 133, 148, 152, 180 Aristoteles, 76, 77, 164 Artech, 221 Artificial satellite, 186 Arzachel, 99, 123, 124 Ashen light, 315 Asterism, 315, 316, 318, 332 Asteroid, 74, 133, 152, 305, 315, 318 belt, 205 impact, 158 Astigmatism, 315 Astrologer, 327 Astrology, 333 Astrophotography, 215, 304 AstroStack, 221, 227 Atlas, 84, 162 Atmosphere, 192, 280, 281, 284, 285 Audio visual interleave, 315 Aurora, 319 Autolycus, 89 Automatic focus, 252 Automatic mode, 3–4 AVI, 221, 315 B Baader filter, 315, 323 Babbage, 115 Baby, 168 Bailly, 156, 158, 159 Baily's Beads, 156 Ball, 95, 126 Bancroft, 86 Bandpass, 248, 276, 315, 316, 320, 326, 332 Barlow, 42, 219 lens, 20, 42, 230, 249, 250, 322, 324 Bartels, 143 Barycenter, 58, 315, 316, 320 Batteries rechargeable, 19 Bayer, 99 Bayer filter mosaic, 316 Beehive, 5, 316, 317, 327 cluster, 291 Beer, 86 Bernouilli, 82 Berosus, 137 Bessarion, 91, 152 Bessel, 74, 136 Beta Cygni, 297 Bettinus, 99, 156, 159 Bianchini, 90 Big Dipper, 313, 315, 316, 326, 328, 332 Billy, 147 Binary system, 313, 316, 320, 326, 327, 329, 330 Binocular mount, 4 Binoculars, 3–5, 12, 13, 42, 47, 73, 75, 118, 200, 218, 249, 312–316, 319, 321, 322, 332 Birmingham, 115 Birt, 124, 170 BK-7, 316 Black drop, 280, 285, 287 effect, 316 Blancanus, 99, 158 Bliss, 89, 112 Blocking filter, 316 Blue, 329 Blue moon, 58 Book, 331 Boscovich, 128 Bracketing, 46 Brayley, 91 Brianchon, 116 Broadband, 316, 321, 322 filters, 316 Brocchi's Cluster, 317 Brown dwarf, 317 Bullialdus, 161 Burkhardt, 82 C C8, 20, 29 CaK, 317 Calcium, 317 Calcium K, 249, 276, 277, 316–318, 320, 321, 326 light, 277 solar diagonal, 276 California Nebula, 317 Callisto, 206, 218, 323 Camelopardalis, 317 Camera, 304, 305, 322, 324, 329, 330 bracket, 304 tripod, 30, 251, 253 Campanus, 162 Canals, 317 Cancer, 5, 291, 316, 317 Cape Agarum, 80 Capella, 139, 140 Captain Cook, 283 Capuanus, 129, 162 Cardanus, 143 Carmichael, 80 Carrel, 84, 172 Cassini, 77, 117, 206 division, 224 Cassini-Huygens, 215 336 Index Catalog, 317, 326 Catharina, 103, 118, 120 Cavalerius, 144 Cayley, 129 CCD, 205, 304 Celestial mechanics, 329, 330 Celestial sphere, 317 Celestron C8, 29 Cell structure, 317 CEMAX eyepiece, 276 CEMAX eyepiece set, 250 CEMAX 12 mm, 251 Centaurus, 313, 318 Center of gravity, 316, 320 Cepheus, 86 Ceres, 315 Cetus, 333 C.
