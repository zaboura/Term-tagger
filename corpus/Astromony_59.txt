Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Jan 15 First Quarter Moon Jan 08 Last Quarter Moon Jan 23 New Moon Jan 30 The surge of DSLR photography has brought a unique opportunity to the world of astronomy. Ben Canales will speak about the ability of this growing night photography interest to connect newcomers to the expansive world of traditional astronomy. Ben will also share photos and timelapse videos of our night skies above the landscapes of our Pacific Northwest. Ben would like to end the talk with a short "workshop" on the settings and details of using a DSLR for star shots to be a "go forth" moment for anyone interested in trying it out. B a s e d o u t o f P o r t l a n d , Oregon, Ben Canales' night photography of the stars has been f ea tu red on OPB 's Oregon Field Guide, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, National Geographic Travel Photo of the Year, and is a winner of the contest The World At Night.

Page 2 A New Year's Message From The President... As we begin the New Year of 2014, I think this is a good time to reflect back on 2013 and look-forward into 2014 – and beyond – from my perspective as your rookie-President. 2013 was by all accounts a very good year for the Rose City Astronomers. We grew our membership to over 400 member-families and students We remain financially healthy with reserve funds for special projects We reviewed and updated the RCA Bylaws We had a great line-up of speakers We launched the Youth Astronomy Academy We launched the Youth Telescope Making Project We established the Youth Education and Scholarship Fund We successfully completed our first full year of operating the Haggart Observatory We expanded our education and outreach audience We had some great star parties Looking into my crystal ball for 2014, I see even more observing events for our members, more members volunteering for more outreach events than ever before, and increased public awareness and recognition for the contributions and accomplishments of RCA in astronomy outreach and education. At our Board Meeting in January, we adopted an Outreach and Education Vision Statement that reflects this Board's recognition of the important role RCA can and needs to play in expanding astronomy outreach and education. RCA shall use its resources, expertise, and member-volunteers to develop and implement programs and projects throughout our city, state and region that will serve to introduce and educate the general public on astronomy, and facilitate their participation in observing opportunities. As one of the largest amateur astronomy clubs in the country with a growing membership and an influx of new and active member-volunteers, my belief is that RCA can be a leader and major influence within our metropolitan home base in advancing the campaign to reduce light pollution, and also throughout our state and region in establishing a network of youth education programs and instructors. At January's Board Meeting we also updated our Sister Club Program Guidelines with an eye towards es-tablishing informal and formal relationships with other astronomers throughout the state, particularly in rural areas, to offer RCA's experience and resources to communities and groups wishing to create or grow astronomy clubs and/or promote astronomy in their communities through outreach and education. This won't reduce our interest in establishing international relationships but rather create an opportunity for us to make new friends in dark places around the state. Our inaugural Youth Astronomy Class in 2013 was a big success with 10 students and our first 2014 Class will begin in February. In the fall of this year we hope to expand the program with a second level course and occasional technical lectures. These are unquestionably some ambitious plans, but an example of how RCA is starting to take bigger and bolder steps towards fulfilling our mission spelled out in our original 1988 Articles of Incorporation: "RCA is a non-profit, volunteer organization dedicated to promoting the enjoyment and education of astron-omy and related subjects to members and the general public." We wouldn't be heading down this road if not for the enthusiastic response from members when we ask for volunteers and the positive feedback we are receive from participants. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

St. Helens (that we hope will become an annual event) A Star Party at Indian Trail Spring in September And a first (that I know of) Summer Picnic and Star Party for all members and families With some regret because of the long history of the event, we have decided not to return to Kah-Nee-Ta this year for a variety of reasons, such as: increased room rates, higher room guarantee and risk, low turn-out in recent years and less than ideal observing logistics. We also have a stellar lineup of speakers to look forward to in 2014, including Heidi Hammel, an accom-plished planetary scientist and key figure in the development of the James Webb Space Telescope; re-nowned comet hunter Don Machholz; and Sky & Telescope Deep Sky Wonders columnist Sue French. All of these activities would not be possible without the dedicated efforts of our volunteer Board members, Program Coordinators and club members – all giving of their time, talents, enthusiasm and passion to serve our membership, grow the astronomy-community and further enhance the reputation of the Rose City As-tronomers. To you all – a standing ovation! Heads Up in 2014!

All Rights Reserved. Page 5 How to see IC 434 Everyone wants to see the Horsehead Nebula through their own scope, and the good news is that, given the proper circumstances, it's within the realm of possibility for many people. But to see the Horsehead, a dark nebula, you really need to be able to see IC 434, the "bright" nebula that the Horsehead is silhouetted against. Without IC 434 in the background, the Horsehead wouldn't be visible. The catch - isn't there always a catch? - is that you'll need a few things to have decent chance of success: Dark and transparent skies. An h-beta filter. Experience using averted vision. And if you've never seen the Horsehead there are two more things you need to know: The appropriate magnification to use. What to expect. Let's go over each item in more detail... Dark and Transparent skies What exactly does "dark and transparent skies" mean? A good rule of thumb to use in this case is how well you can see the winter Milky Way. If you can't see it well – or at all – you either need to get further from city lights or the night just isn't transparent enough to take advantage of the darkness. The brighter and bet-ter defined the winter Milky Way appears, the greater the odds that you'll be able to see the Horsehead Nebula through your scope. H-beta filter The 'h' stands for hydrogen and h-beta filter isolates the wavelength of hydrogen-beta around 486 nanome-ters (nm) making it a narrow (8 to 10nm) pass-band filter. This is the very red color that shows up so beau-tifully in photographs. IC 434 is quite red because of hydrogen-beta emission, making an h-beta filter the best choice when trying to see IC 434 and observe the Horsehead. Experience using averted vision And what is averted vision? It's a common term in amateur astronomy, and most people realize that it in-volves looking off to one side of a faint object so the more areas of the eye most sensitive to faint light can be used to best advantage. Looking to the side of the object you want to see is counter-intuitive and takes practice to develop but it's also effective the first time you try it. Practice helps and soon you'll find the most sensitive areas of your eye to maximize your observations of faint objects like IC 434.. The Observer's Corner Howard Banich ESO image of B33, the Horsehead Nebula ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 6 The appropriate magnification So how do you find out the best magnification to use? Lumicon, the manufacturer of the leading h-beta fil-ter, provides specific information on how to select magnifications that give you the best chance to see the Horsehead. They provide this info on their website for all their filters at http://www.lumicon.com/ pdf/3filterspec_prnt.pdf . Here's what they say about their h -beta filter: "As filter band pass decreases, optimum exit pupil size tends to increase. To determine the best eyepiece focal length to use with a given filter, simply multiply the Exit Pupil value shown (below) by your telescope's focal ratio. For example, if you are using the Lumicon H-Beta filter at a dark site and your telescope has an f/6 focal ratio, the best range of eyepiece focal lengths to use with this filter is [(4 to 7) x 6] = 24mm to 42mm." "Optimum Exit Pupil (Light polluted sky) for Lumicon h-beta filter = 3 to 7mm Optimum Exit Pupil (Dark sky) for Lumicon h-beta filter = 4 to 7mm" That means that for my f4 scopes I should use magnifications from 16mm to 28mm under a dark sky, and 12mm to 28mm under a light polluted sky. I've generally found that the Horsehead is most visible using a 13mm to 21mm eyepiece, so that fits quite well with Lumicon's advice. What to expect Surprising to many observers is the angular size of the Horsehead – they're looking for a small object and overlook the Horsehead because it's larger than expected. That was certainly the case for me and I'll ad-dress this in more detail further on. What you don't need, although helpful, is a huge telescope. The biggest scope I've looked at the Horse-head with is my 28 inch f4 Newtonian, and not surprisingly, that gave the best view I've had of it so far. On the other hand, I've also seen the Horsehead through the 4.5 inch finder Chuck Dethloff has mounted on his 24 inch f4.1 Dobsonian. Once you've taken care of as many of the variables as you can, and find yourself under a dark, transparent winter sky with the proper eyepieces, an h-beta filter and experience using averted vision, where exactly is the Horsehead and what might you see? How to see IC 434 and the Horsehead Here's a DSS image of the general region of the Horsehead Nebula, also known as Barnard 33, or B33 for short. Two of the three stars of Orion's belt are labeled, as are two NGC nebulae and IC 434. This is a big chunk of sky – approximately 2 degrees wide. It's important to understand the scale shown here so you get a good feel for how big the Horsehead will appear in your scope. The Astronomy Picture of the Day site has a wonderful color photo of this area at http:// apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131212.html showing and even chunk of sky with all three of Orion's belt stars. http://www.lumicon.com/pdf/3filterspec_prnt.pdf http://www.lumicon.com/pdf/3filterspec_prnt.pdf http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131212.html http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131212.html ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 7 By the way, NGC 2024 is known by many names, such as the Flame or Tractor Tire Nebula and is a good reason to visit this neighborhood too. The large circle in the black and white DSS image shows the field of view of a 13mm Ethos eyepiece in my 8 inch f4 scope. Notice how magnitude 1.9 Alnitak – the lower left star in Orion's Belt – dominates the view. It will completely hide the two NGC nebulae and the Horsehead unless you place it outside the field of view, like the next image. Now that Alnitak is out of the field, look for NGC 2023. It may appear as a faint mist enveloping a moderately faint star, and if you can see it without too much trouble your chances for success with the Horsehead are pretty good. Take this article with you so you can note the position of the Horsehead in relation to NGC 2023 and a few of the nearby field stars so you're looking in exactly the right spot. It's unlikely, but not impossible that you'll see the very faint streak of IC 434, and knowing its orientation to Alnitak and NGC 2023 will be a big help in keeping your bearings. Now notice that although the Horsehead looks small in these photos, they depict a huge chunk of sky, so the Horsehead is actually fairly large in the field of view of the eyepiece. It's 6 x 8 arc minutes in size, which is a little lar-ger than M27, the Dumbbell Nebula. This is important to keep in mind because this is often much larger than expected. The next thing to remember is that the Horse-head has very low contrast with IC 434, the "bright" nebula behind it, and even with the h-beta filter IC 434 will be one of the faintest nebulae you'll barely see. More than likely you'll notice the sky is ever so slightly brighter in IC 434's region. Ok, now it's time to look for the Horsehead itself. Excited? Good! That means you're alert and ready - but don't forget to breathe. Seri-ously, take a deep breathe or two and relax. A few slow, deep breaths will oxygenate your blood and will help your dark adapted eye-sight be as sensitive as possible. It's surpris-ingly common to hold your breath while try-ing to make a difficult observation like this, so be aware of your breathing. I've adjusted the previous DSS photo to mimic what I've seen in the eyepiece to give ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 you an idea of what to expect. It's typical to see the Horsehead as a notch in IC 434 that's ever so slightly darker than the sur-rounding sky. Although this adjusted photo is not a completely accurate depic-tion of what's seen through a telescope, it is fairly close. See the dark notch? Ok, but what about a bigger scope and how much better can the view become? I haven't sketched the Horsehead yet, so I've adjusted the same DSS image to show approximately what I've seen through my 28 inch f4 Newtonian using a 21mm Ethos eyepiece and an h-beta fil-ter. This image mimics my very best view of the Horsehead. IC434 was faint but eas-ily seen as an elongated area with the eastern edge having a distinct boundary, while the western edge gradually faded away. The best part was IC 434 outlined the horsehead shape with what seemed to be a slightly brighter border. The nose was seen quite well, making this one of the very few times the Horsehead Nebula looked like a horsehead instead of a dark notch. It was a "hey everyone, come over and look at THIS!" kind of view. Fabulous! There's a wonderful sketch by Cindy Krach of the Haleakala Astronomers on Maui made with a 12.5 inch Newtonian posted on the Astronomy Sketch of the Day site at http://www.asod.info/?p=11148 that shows a similar view. Whatever size scope you have, give the Horsehead Nebula a shot this winter, or failing that, wait until its high enough in the pre-dawn sky at the OSP next August. Be prepared and keep trying if you don't see it. If you come up empty, you either need a bit of practice and/or a better night. Even though the Horsehead is never visually spectacular, even in large scopes and on the darkest, most transparent nights, seeing it at all makes it one of sky's more subtle and evocative pleasures. Just remember that you're really trying to see IC 434 and that the brighter it appears the better the Horsehead will look. http://www.asod.info/?p=11148 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 An Image and Reality Margaret McCrae This last summer, 2013, I was fortunate to travel in England, Scotland and Wales with my two sisters. When we arrived in London, I took the time to visit Greenwich Park, where the Royal Observatory and Flamsteed House, as well as the Prime Meridian marker, are all located. All of these can be looked up on Wikipedia, so this article is just a few of my impressions. It takes a long time to walk through the park to get to the Royal Observatory, but that's okay, it's a lovely park and one of the largest green spaces in London. There is a wide panoramic view of the city, looking north across the Thames to the city proper, and that is partly why the observatory was built there. In 1675, this was a rural viewpoint and was a natural site for an observatory. The lights from the city would not have been a con-sideration in those days. And since the promontory is not right next to the river, but is set back a fair distance, evaporation and dew would not have been a problem either. The observatory itself was a bit of a maze and once you get in, you have to follow signs that take you up, down, around and across, but you can't turn around and go back and a couple times I could barely squeeze around the displays. The observatory was being remodeled, so visiting was tricky - - and there were so many visitors! I didn't know there would be so many German high schools on school trips in London. But I can hon-estly say that I have [accidentally] touched the mount of the royal telescope that marks the prime meridian. The scope itself was not there. But I was surprised to learn that the Prime Meridian was designated to run exactly through the middle of that particular telescope. The Airy Transit Circle points right down the middle of that scope. And I was even more surprised to learn that the meridian had been moved from a previous line (the Brad-ley Line) just a few feet over to the left of this telescope when a new scope was installed. And I thought these measurements were absolutes! The home of the Astronomers Royal, the Flamsteed House, sits just a few feet away from the Observatory, and was a much more pleasant place to visit. It is a small but nicely appointed house, suitable for a family with children and servants, who need places to play and work and study and get warm by the fireplace. It must have been fun to be a child growing up in that unique place, with a great view from the dining room. In the living room there was a timeline display of all the Astronomers Royal who had occupied that house, named for John Flamsteed who was the first (1675 – 1719) and the creator of the Flamsteed Atlas Coelestis. Edmund Halley was the second, followed by fourteen more distinguished occupants. By the 1920s, the functions of the observa-tory were being moved off site and since the 1950s, if I remember right, there is not really a royal astronomer any more, except as a ceremonial position. But there is real astronomy still being carried on - - at Cambridge University. In the basement was a very nice display of the John Harrison clocks - - the series of clocks that he made to solve the problem of longitude. I'm a fan of Dava Sobel's book, Longitude, and suddenly, here in front of me, were the very timepieces she was talking about. I stayed a long time at the exhibit, called Time and Longitude, http:// www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/on-display/time-and-longitude, and read every single description of every single item in that display. My favorite line is " This is the most important timekeeper ever made." It was the label for Harrison's fourth and final marine timekeeper, now called H4 (photo left). The size and shape of the prob-lem was right in front of us. How to tell time - - and thus know where you are - - at sea? On top of the observatory is a ball that was dropped at noon every day to help ships at sea - - if they happened to be close enough to see it. Sometime in the 1920s, I believe, a storm broke the ball off the roof. And earlier I had visited Edinburgh Cas-tle, where at 1:00 o'clock daily, a canon is fired, again to let the ships at sea know what time it is in town. Neither method worked very well, obviously. H4 was a leap into the modern world. Very nice. http://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/on-display/time-and-longitude http://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/on-display/time-and-longitude ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 Then came the biggest surprise of all - - the Octagon Room at the top of the house. Imagine my surprise when I walked into a large, light, open, airy room and recognized it because I have seen the woodcut image of it at least a hundred times. You no doubt have seen this image. Here it is today. It just took my breath away. First, I wasn't expecting it. And second, it was just so beautiful. I stayed a long time, then went to eat lunch and went back and started the whole visit over again. I went quickly through the observatory, quickly through the exhibit in the basement, and almost ran upstairs to see the Octagon Room again. It was designed to be a showplace and visitor center for the royalty who were paying for the observatory. I hated to leave. I obligingly stood in line so I could stand in front of the marker for the Prime Meridian, with one foot in the western hemisphere and one in the eastern. Unfortunately, my sisters had gone shopping at Har-rods that day so I was by myself and my camera was broken, so I have no memento of this important occasion, but I am satisfied that I was there. I spent the rest of the afternoon visiting the rest of Greenwich Park: the Queen's House with its Tulip Stairs and amazing art collection, the Naval School and Hospital, and the endlessly lovely groomed grounds of the park. I thought I'd be there for two hours. I spent all day. And I was surprised by one more thing: for years I have not had much re-gard for King Charles II and his era, called the Restoration. England had experimented with a new form of government by beheading King Charles I and setting up a new parliament. Unfortunately, that was not a move toward openness and democracy; it was a form of religious absolutism and dictatorship, and it didn't last very long. When King Charles II and the aristocracy returned to claim their privileges, they came back with a vengeance. The Restoration was a time of riotous excess by the wealthy. But then I learned that Charles II was genuinely interested in science. He founded the Royal Observatory, created the position of Astronomer Royal and appointed Flamsteed to the position. He also granted funds to the collection of learned men who became the Royal Society of London, King Charles' scien-tific advisory body. Okay, he had twelve illegitimate children by seven mistresses, but he also reopened the pubs and listened to his scientific advisors. The Merry Monarch also had a brain. Margaret McCrea December 3, 2013 The Universe is about 100 million years older than pre-viously estimated and is expanding slightly more slowly; it also has slightly more dark matter and a bit less dark energy than previously suspected. There is no evidence for an addi-tional neutrino-like relativistic particle beyond the three families of neutrinos that have already been discovered; their total mass is not more than 0.23 electron volts, about half the upper limit from the earlier results from NASAs Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Those are the key findings revealed by the most accurate and detailed map of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)—the oldest light in the Universe, dating back to 370,000 years after the Big Bang—produced from the first 15.5 months of data from the Planck satellite and analyzed using one of the world's most powerful supercomputers. The researchers included, among others, University of California faculty from Berkeley (George Smoot and Mar-tin White), Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory (R. Keskitalo), Davis (Lloyd Knox), the U.S. Department of Energy National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Labor-atory (Julian Borrill and T.S. Kisner), and Santa Barbara (Philip Lubin, P. R. Meinhold, and Andrea Zonca). A trillion data points The Planck satellite, designed and built by the European Space Agency (ESA) with significant contributions from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was launched in May 2009 and began scientific observations in mid-August. Like its NASA prede-cessors the Cosmic Back-ground Explor-er (COBE) and WMAP, Planck's mis-sion is to map tiny tempera-ture fluctua-tions in the microwave background radiation bath-ing the heav-ens, left from the Big Bang. But both Planck's sensitivity and its resolu-tion are unprecedented. Planck is 930,000 miles away, on the opposite side of Earth from the sun, in the gravitationally semi-stable L2 libration point where it keeps up with Earth in its orbit. That orbit plus Plank's spinning on its axis allows the space-craft's 72 detectors to scan successive narrow (2 arcminutes wide) strips or rings around the heavens, building up a map of rings covering the complete sky twice a year. As Planck measures some 10,000 samples per second, in its first 15.5 months of observing, it has gathered a trillion data points. Analyzing such a massive data set is a monumental computational challenge. So in 2007, before the spacecraft was launched, NASA and the DOE negotiated a formal interagency agreement that provided the Planck mission multiyear access to NERSC. Especially challenging is the task not only of separating the CMB from the unavoidable instrumental noise and fore-ground signals from our Milky Way galaxy, but also of then understanding precisely how well this separation has been done. Using a technique called Monte Carlo simulations, the data were crunched on NERSC's 150,000-core Cray XE6 supercomputer Hopper. Refining our understanding Although future data releases in 2014 and 2015 will add in results from polarization and other measurements, this first release of data reveals results that are already surpris-ing. The Planck data reveal that the Universe is 13.8 billion years old, more precise than the previously ac-cepted age of 13.7 billion years. The Hub-ble constant— the rate at which the Universe is expanding—is revised down-ward to only 67.80 plus or minus 0.77 kilometers per second per mega-parsec (a megaparsec is about 3 million light-years). Planck's results also indicate that dark energy makes up "only" 69.2 percent (plus or minus 1.0 percent) of the densi-ty of the Universe (instead of 71.4 percent as measured by WMAP). Thus, dark matter and ordinary matter make up a heftier 30.86 percent. –Trudy E.

Page 12 The Big Picture: GOES-R and the Advanced Baseline Imager By Kieran Mulvaney The ability to watch the development of storm systems – ideally in real time, or as close as possible – has been an invaluable benefit of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) system, now entering its fortieth year in service. But it has some-times come with a trade-off: when the equipment on the satellite is focused on such storms, it isn't always able to monitor weat her elsewhere. "Right now, we have this kind of conflict," explains Tim Schmit of NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Informa-tion Service (NESDIS). "Should we look at the broad scale, or look at the storm scale?" That should change with the upcoming launch of the first of the latest generation of GOES satellites, dubbed the GOES-R series, which will carry aloft a piece of equipment called the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). According to Schmit, who has been working on its development since 1999, the ABI will provide images more frequently, at greater resolution and across more spectral bands (16, compared to five on existing GOES satellites). Perhaps most excitingly, it will also allow simultaneous scanning of both the broader view and not one but two concurrent storm systems or other small-scale patterns, such as wildfires, over areas of 1000km x 1000km. Although the spatial resolution will not be any greater in the smaller areas than in the wider field of view, the significantly greater temporal resolution on the smaller scale (providing one image a minute) will allow meteorologists to see weather events unfold al-most as if they were watching a movie. So, for example, the ABI could be pointed at an area of Oklahoma where conditions seem primed for the formation of tornadoes. "And now you start getting one -minute data, so you can see small-scale clouds form, the convergence and growth," says Schmit. In August, Schmit and colleagues enjoyed a brief taste of how that might look when they turned on the GOES-14 satellite, which serves as an orbiting backup for the existing generation of satellites. "We were allowed to do some experimental imaging with this one -minute imagery," Schmit explains. "So we were able to simulate the temporal component of what we will get with ABI when it's launched." The result was some imagery of cloud formation that, while not of the same resolution as the upcoming ABI images, unfolded on the same time scale. You can compare the difference between it and the existing GOES-13 imagery here: http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/ goes/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GOES1314_VIS_21AUG2013loop.gif Learn more about the GOES-R series of satellites here: http://www.goes-r.gov.

Hammel Everyone Welcome! Monday February 17th Intro to Astrophotography Meeting Begins: 6:30 pm. OMSI Planetarium. General Meeting 7:30 pm Location: OMSI Auditorium ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers All Rights Reserved. Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Feb 14 First Quarter Moon Feb 06 Last Quarter Moon Feb 22 New Moon Mar 01 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is NASA's next Great Observatory, the scientific successor to both the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Its scientific equipment will include several cameras to produce amazing images in the tradition of Hubble. JWST will see the first galaxies to form in the universe, and explore how stars are born and develop planetary systems. It will examine planets around other stars to investigate their potential for life, and study planets within our own Solar System. This innovative telescope represents a major step forward in technology, with a segmented mirror three times larger than Hubble that operates a million miles away in the cold, dark environment of Earth's Lagrange 2 point. Dr. Heidi B. Hammel is one of the six Interdisciplinary Scientists for this cutting-edge facility, which is scheduled to launch in 2018. In this public lecture, Dr. Hammel will update you on the telescope's current status with images and videos. She will also give an update of JWST's anticipated science: JWST's potential for measuring water in the atmospheres of exoplanets, JWST's capacity to detect the light of the first galaxies to form in the Universe, the ability of JWST to study the coldest objects within our own Solar System, and much more. Bio: Heidi B. Hammel Planetary astronomer Heidi Hammel -- a world authority on the planets Neptune and Uranus -- is known for her many achievements probing the cosmos, often using the famous Hubble Space Telescope. In 1994 when comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashed into Jupiter, Heidi was the leader of the team that analyzed images of the event taken with Hubble. She was also a member of the research group that first spotted Neptune's Great Dark Spot (a raging storm as big as Earth) with the Voyager spacecraft, and led a Hubble team that later documented the Great Dark Spot's disappearance. Today she is involved in another milestone: helping to develop the next great space observatory that will succeed Hubble -- the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to be launched later in 2018. "As much as I love Hubble, it's time to build an even more sophisticated tool that will enable us to see new things," says Dr. Hammel. "Webb will probe regions of the cosmos that are simply not visible to Hubble," she explains. "It's much bigger and it will be tuned to wavelengths that Hubble can't see. With Webb, we have the potential to answer questions about the origins of just about everything in the universe."

After a post-doctoral position at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, she returned to MIT, where she spent nearly nine years as a Principal Research Scientist. She then worked as a Senior Research Scientist and co-Director of Research at the Space Science Institute until 2011. Dr. Hammel is now the Executive Vice President of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). AURA -- a consortium of 39 U.S. universities and institutions, as well as seven international affiliates -- operates world-class astronomical observatories including Hubble, the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the National Solar Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory. Dr. Hammel primarily studies planets. Her current research involves studies of Uranus and Neptune with Hubble, the Keck 10-m telescope, and other Earth-based observatories. For the Planetary Decadal Survey released in 2011, Dr. Hammel led the Giant Planets Panel; in that role, she was involved in designing and characterizing a number of mission studies for outer solar system exploration. Dr. Hammel has been widely recognized for her work. She was profiled by the New York Times in 2008[1], Newsweek Magazine in 2007[2], and was identified as one of the 50 most important women in science by Discover Magazine in 2002[3]. She was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2000. In 1996, she received the Urey Prize from the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences. Dr. Hammel has also been lauded for her work in public outreach, including the 2002 Sagan Medal for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public, the 1996 "Spirit of American Women" National Award for encouraging young women to follow non-traditional career paths, and the San Francisco Exploratorium's 1998 Public Understanding of Science Award. Asteroid "1981 EC20" has been renamed 3530 Hammel in her honor.

Known by every beginner, it is the middle star in his blade, appearing as a fuzzy spot to the unaided eye. Designated by the Greek letter theta (θ), the area, over one degree wide, is covered in greenish and rose colored mist. Near its cha-otic heart is a wonderful multiple star called the Trapezium (θ1 Orionis). Four-fold in small telescopes and binoculars, the individ-ual stars range in brightness from fifth to seventh magnitude. Bewitching as it may seem, the deep-sky terrain around this little trape-zoid holds many more pleasant visual surprises. Most of the truly great dis-coveries in astronomy came shortly after the invention of the telescope. In 1610, Nicholas Peiresc became the first person to properly characterize M42. Later on in that same century, G. B. Hodierna and famed Dutch optician/horologist Christiaan Huyghens both made primitive sketches of the 2.9 magnitude nebula. Observations in the following years mush-roomed, making this legendary wintertime showpiece a top destination for newcomers and experienced astronomers. Messier's drawing from 1771 accurately portrays the appear-ance through minor instruments. Naturally, it has the Trapezium along with the nebula's filamen-tary extensions and infamous dark intrusion or "Fish's Mouth." John Herschel's fine rendition, made with a consid-erably larger 18-inch reflector, echoes the viewing sentiment through modern equipment. In that black and white sketch, delicate cobwebs of fossilized light branch outward from a textured center. Today's Internet is overflowing with evoca-tive drawings by skilled amateurs, and offers a vast database of beautiful photographic images and plates. There are many ways of reading M42's appearance, but all are aperture dependent. Large telescopes show a wealth of intricate detail. Mottling, a distinctive pinkish or red color, and numerous eddies and rifts charac-terize the diffuse nebula. Patrick Moore, in his book The New Atlas of the Universe, displays a wonderfully complex picture tak-en by the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Oth-ers, including John Mallas (The Messier Album) who used a classic 4-inch Unitron re-fractor for his observations, suggest a plain greenish-gray ring structure, bounded by great luminous bands or winged arcs. Indi-viduals with a more creative imagination see the feathery nebula as a kind of celestial bat, cupped hand or incandescent rose. One of the most telling descriptions comes from 19th century master observer George P. Bond, who wrote: "It is now impossible to see in it any other aspect than as a maze of radiating, spiral-like wreaths of nebulosity, or filamentous tentacles; the centre of the vortex being about the trapezium." According to the distance measurements provided by scien-tists, M42 lies roughly 1,300 light-years away. Its forceful stellar wind has carved out a deep cavity some 30 light-years across in the Orion Complex, a huge molecular cloud that en-gulfs virtually the entire region. The strong ultraviolet radiation from hot newborn stars in the Trapezium has caused the sur-rounding gas to fluoresce, im-parting the familiar colors seen through the telescope. A mael-strom of primordial hydrogen — star stuff — gives substance to M42. Enough of this rarified el-ement exists to form over 10,000 future suns like our own. How-ever, the greenish tinge owes its origin to doubly ionized oxygen, a minor but telltale constituent scattered throughout M42's cot-tony domain. Of all the winter's emission nebulae, it undoubtedly has the finest center or core, which John Herschel referred to as "the breaking up of a mackerel sky." Appearing as a fabulous vortex of patterned swirls and nebulous loops, the "Huyghenian Region" also contains a long protrusion of black interstellar dust known as the Fish's Mouth. Toward the southeast is Theta2, an easily split telescopic double — through most any instrument its two components form a quaint The Great Nebula in Orion Travel to the Hunter's Sword for a fabulous look at the sky's most popular nebula.

By definition, M42 (NGC 1976) is the fan-shaped glow that spreads southward from Theta1. The outer ramparts eventually curl against Iota (ι) Orionis, a lavish trio of bluish-white and orange suns. Positioned at the very bottom of the sword, it has 3rd and 7th magnitude components separated by 11"; another 11th-magnitude companion lies 50" away. A disordered collection of stars are strategically placed around Iota — the bina-ries 745 and 747 in Wilhelm Struve's catalog are the most noticeable. Although enjoying strong competition from the Trapezium, each of these pairs is too pretty to ignore. Struve 747 (Σ747), just to the southwest of Iota, is perhaps the most inviting. The two-sun system, with 4.7 and 5.5 magnitude members spaced 36" apart, is wide enough to be resolved in binoculars. Σ745 is a com-promise in brightness. The magnitudes of this still eye-catching duet are 8.4 and 8.7, separation an easy 28". Adorning the northern portion of the grand emission nebula is Messier 43 (NGC 1982). An identifying 7th-magnitude star sits close to its round, fuzzy heart. In appearance, M43 differs significantly from its more fa-mous neighbor: Unlike M42's broad, if bright, glow, M43 possesses a stubby, com-ma-shaped outline. A sinuous trough, vacant of light, runs along its eastern border and connects with the Fish's Mouth. (In reality, M43 is not an isolated cloudscape but an appendage of the greater structure.) A dramatic end to an evening's tour is found only a few short hops to the north. Several of the remaining objects are familiar to novices, like the maverick "Running Man" reflection nebula (NGC 1977) and equally figurative "Coal Car Cluster" (NGC 1981). These two cloaked treasures empha-size the continued blend of stars and irides-cent dust throughout the sword region. NGC 1977, sparse in stellar membership but rich in nebular material, is just ½° north of M43. At 6th-magnitude, it can be chronicled as three gleaming banks or ridges with a judi-cious sprinkling of 15 or so individual stars. NGC 1981, located another 25' to the north and at the sword's hilt, is a loose gathering of mainly bright stars enmeshed in a nonde-script glow; the Y-shaped western portion of the 28' diameter cluster contrasts nicely with the tight arc of stars in its eastern half. The Great Nebula in Orion is a timeless paradise for visual observation and contem-plation. Borrowing from a variety of sources, it has been repeatedly described as "magnifi-cent" and "the most remarkable nebula in the heavens." Whether using a small pair of binoculars, dime store telescope or expensive piece of equipment, it is a never-to-be for-gotten sight, one that is returned to time and again on clear winter nights. The Orion Nebula's flam-ing colors are completely beyond the reach of ordi-nary telescopes unless tested photographically. Resembling a wild ab-stractive painting, the image presented at right is remarkably structured and, at the same time, astronomically elegant. Polychromatic clouds of ionized gas, attributed to lighter elements such as hydrogen, account for its surrealistic appearance. In this scientifically balanced piece from 1852, Bindon Stoney successfully captures the key features of the Huyghenian Region. The famous multiple star Theta1, at the center of the drawing, appears as a little trape-zoid. The "Trapezium" has relatively bright compo-nents that are designated A through D. A dimmer fifth star, called "E," can be seen in a 90mm telescope. Etienne Leopold Trouvelot (1827-95) was a marvelous artist and staff astronomer at Harvard College Observatory. Many of his enduring paper drawings were made through the college's large 15-inch Mertz refractor. His impression of M42's nebulous environment is displayed below, which dates from the 1870s. Aside from its inherent accuracy, Trouvelot's detailed drawing has been an inspiration for future generations of stargazers and sketch artists. Courtesy of M.

Page 6 The moment photons began arriving at Earth short-ly after midnight New Mexico time on Saturday, April 27, 2013, from the spectacular suicide of a massive star and resultant birth of a black hole, cameras began clicking on telescopes both on the ground and in space. Exultant astronomers worldwide captured data at visible, X-ray, gamma-ray, and radio wavelengths from telescopes both on the ground and in space. Three independent RAPTOR (Rapid Telescopes for Optical Response) full-sky monitoring tele-scopes—two in New Mexico and one in Hawaii— caught an optical flash that within seconds brightened up to a peak of 7th magnitude (yes, bright enough to have been seen in an amateur astronomer's telescope had it been pointed north of the triangle in the constel-lation Leo), and then faded over the next minute and a half to below 10th magnitude. Simulta-neously, the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fer-mi satellite, the Burst Alert Tele-scope (BAT) on the Swift satellite, and a veritable armada of other instruments caught the cataclys-mic stellar explo-sion in the act, as did radio telescopes around the world. Even more unu-sual, the explosion left an afterglow across the electro-magnetic spectrum that persisted for weeks following the initial burst. Now, a host of pa-pers in the January 3, 2014, issue of Science magazine reveal in detail just what happened. 'The burst of the century' "This was the burst of the century!" exclaimed James A. Wren, an engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory and co-author of one of the papers. Indeed, GRB 130427A (as it is now called) was the most pow-erful gamma-ray burst and the second-brightest optical flash measured in 18 years. The supernova detonated in a tiny, inconspicuous galaxy with no name some 3.8 billion light-years away. Partly it was so bright because that point of origin is actually five times closer to the Milky Way than typical long-duration gamma-ray bursts moni-tored by Swift, which are from galaxies that are now more than 17 billion light years away from us (thanks to the faster-than-light expansion of the distant uni-verse according to General Relativity). But partly it was so bright because of the explosion's intrinsic power: it released 1054 ergs of energy in all directions, making GRB 130427A one of the most powerful gam-ma-ray bursts ever detected. The comparatively long life of the gamma-ray burst points to the death of a star perhaps 25 to 30 times more massive than the Sun, whose internal core of iron abruptly collapsed in on itself, creating a high-ly magnetized neutron star or black hole. Somehow, this fast-spinning, compact object launches a powerful jet of particles traveling at nearly the speed of light along its axis of rotation. Internal shockwaves within this relativistic jet creates the initial burst of what is called "prompt" emission spanning from optical to gamma-ray wavelengths; in the case of GRB 130427A, the prompt emission lasted about 5 minutes. Then, when the jet starts colliding with the sur-rounding outer layers of the star and interstellar medi-um, external shock waves give rise to a longer-lasting afterglow emission. The afterglow of GRB 130427A—which spanned from radio waves to gam-ma rays—persisted for weeks. 'A Rosetta-Stone event' What made this burst different from most others is that the sheer power of the explosion so comparatively nearby allowed astronomers to follow the star's de-cline in brightness over many wavelengths for weeks, giving them a glimpse into details of the explosion's physics usually too faint to observe. "It is the link between the optical phenomenon and the gamma rays we haven't seen before," observed another Los Alamos co-author Przemek Wozniak. "This was a Rosetta-Stone event that illuminates so many things—literally," affirmed lead author, Los Alamos astrophysicist W. Thomas Vestrand. "These are data that astrophysicists will be looking at for a long time to come." –Trudy E. Bell, M.A. Further reading: Link to the paper "The Bright Optical flash and Afterglow from the Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 130427A" by Vestrand et al. published in Science is at http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5489 .

Page 8 A Two-Toned Wonder from the Saturnian Outskirts By Dr. Ethan Siegel Although Saturn has been known as long as humans have been watching the night sky, it's only since the invention of the telescope that we've learned about the rings and moons of this giant, gaseous world. You might know that the largest of Saturn's moons is Ti-tan, the second largest moon in the entire Solar System, discovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. It was just 16 years later, in 1671, that Giovanni Cassini (for whom the famed division in Saturn's rings—and the NASA mission now in orbit there—is named) discovered the second of Saturn's moons: Iapetus. Unlike Titan, Iapetus could only be seen when it was on the west side of Saturn, leading Cassini to correctly conclude that not only was Iapetus tidally locked to Saturn, but that its trailing hemisphere was intrinsi-cally brighter than its darker, leading hemisphere. This has very much been confirmed in modern times! In fact, the darkness of the leading side is comparable to coal, while the rest of Iapetus is as white as thick sea ice. Iapetus is the most distant of all of Saturn's large moons, with an average orbital distance of 3.5 million km, but the culprit of the mysterious dark side is four times as distant: Saturn's remote, captured moon, the dark, heavily cratered Phoebe! Orbiting Saturn in retrograde, or the opposite direction to Saturn's rotation and most of its other Moons, Phoebe most probably origi-nated in the Kuiper Belt, migrating inwards and eventually succumbing to gravitational capture. Due to its orbit, Phoebe is constantly bombarded by micrometeoroid-sized (and larger) objects, responsible for not only its dented and cavity-riddled surface, but also for a huge, diffuse ring of dust grains spanning quadrillions of cubic kilometers! The presence of the "Phoebe Ring" was only discovered in 2009, by NASA's infrared-sensitive Spitzer Space Telescope. As the Phoebe Ring's dust grains absorb and re-emit solar radiation, they spiral inwards towards Saturn, where they smash into Iapetus—orbiting in the opposite direction—like bugs on a highway windshield. Was the dark, leading edge of Iapetus due to it being plastered with material from Phoebe? Did those impacts erode the bright surface layer away, revealing a darker substrate? In reality, the dark particles picked up by Iapetus aren't enough to explain the incredible brightness differences alone, but they absorb and retain just enough extra heat from the Sun during Iapetus' day to sublimate the ice around it, which resolidifies preferentially on the trailing side, lightening it even further. So it's not just a thin, dark layer from an alien moon that turns Iapetus dark; it's the fact that surface ice sublimates and can no longer reform atop the leading side that darkens it so severely over time. And that story—only confirmed by observa-tions in the last few years—is the reason for the one-of-a-kind ap-pearance of Saturn's incredible two-toned moon, Iapetus!

Understanding why some galaxies form stars more quickly and in a greater quantity than other galaxies is a fundamental question in astronomy. I use a sample of distant galaxies to investigate how star formation proceeds and how the process of star formation affects the shape of galaxies. Specifically, I use data from the Hubble and Keck telescopes to study how star formation can cause bubbles of gas and dust to be blown out of galaxies ("galactic winds"). I investigate the prevalence of these galactic winds as a function of galaxy properties and find that galaxies with a higher surface density of star formation possess more galactic winds. These findings imply that high densities of stars (i.e., clusters of stars) are necessary in order to expel gas and dust from galaxies. By removing gas and dust from galaxies, the fuel necessary for star formation is removed. Galactic winds accordingly act as a feedback mechanism that regulates star formation in galaxies. Katherine Kornei earned her Bachelor's degree in astrophysics from Yale University in 2006 and her doctorate in astronomy from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2012. Her doctoral thesis focused on star formation in distant galaxies and the morphologies of galaxies. Katherine has worked at NASA Ames Research Center as a research assistant and has obtained data from the Hubble and Keck telescopes. Katherine currently works as a science educator for OMSI and The Lawrence Hall of Science (at UC Berkeley). Katherine also works as an editor for The Astrophysical Journal, where she has edited over 150 research manuscripts. Since joining the RCA in January 2013, Katherine has helped to develop the RCA Youth Astronomy Academy. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved.

By John W. Siple eople are accustomed to seeing Canis Major's popular star clus-ters. Although spectacular, you've never really explored the constella-tion until you've paid a visit to the emission nebula called Thor's Helmet (NGC 2359) — or attempted to capture images from your telescope's camera. A symbolic interpreta-tion of this important celestial sight leans toward Scandinavian lore, where its nebu-lous loops trace out the margins of a horned Viking helmet. Thor himself, god of thunder and war, is sometimes pictured wearing the headdress, the lightning-blue streamers rep-resenting his vented wrath and anger. Located in a majestic setting, it lies di-rectly northeast of the dog star Sirius and next to the beautiful naked-eye cluster pair of M46 and M47. This rich expanse of the winter Milky Way contains an astonishing number of stellar associations and other galactic objects. Because of the emission nebula's soft or muted glow, it's normally missed during a casual telescopic search. When finally found, it appears as an indis-tinct 9th-magnitude patch of haze, having rotund dimensions of 13' X 11'. The surface brightness is quite low for an object of this caliber, but detail improves significantly through the use of select astro-filters. In normal light, Thor's Helmet is hardly more than a weak brightening of the sky background, but of course its strength grows with each step in aperture. A miraculous transformation occurs when an oxygen III or narrowband filter is placed in the telescope. (The benefit of using appropriate filters can-not be overstated, especially when applied to certain types of emission and planetary nebu-lae. They operate on the principle of passing and blocking discrete wavelengths of light.) A 4-inch scope will show a heavily mot-tled midsection along with two main up-raised extensions. Doubling or tripling the aperture brings out considerably more fine detail. It now becomes a riveting structure of otherworldly design, where twisted strands of thicker nebulosity — the pointed horns — curve outward from a once amorphous cen-ter. A gauzy framework of electrifying coils embellishes the lemon-shaped core, swirling in haphazard fashion about an 11½-magnitude central star. When the nebula complex is oriented nearly north and south, telescope owners may perceive a large "numeral 2" figure from its brightest lit portions. The most prominent gilded spike, other than the long gradual curve at the crosshatched center, bends toward the west-southwest, splitting eventually into two streams of milky lumi-nescence. Fat topical glows are also clearly visible opposite the sharp horns, gourd-like features that meander counterclockwise against a rich backdrop of intervening stars. At a distance of 15,000 light-years, the bubble-like structure is over ten times as remote as the famous Orion Nebula. The illuminating powerhouse is an extremely hot and unstable star that belongs to the Wolf-Rayet spectral class. This category is re-served for massive, highly luminous stars that possess temperatures between 25,000 °K and 50,000 °K — rare and rapidly changing occupants on the chart of stellar evolution. The blazing central star, a prime supernova candidate, has spewed out repeated waves of hot ionized material; the crackle-glass shock-wave pattern is especially evident through 14-inch and larger backyard instruments. Several exemplary open clusters inhabit the same general area, worthwhile distrac-tions while scanning for NGC 2359. The best sight is probably NGC 2360, a rich mass of stardust easily spotted 3.4° east of Gamma (γ) Canis Majoris. An attractive assemblage, it consists of over one hundred shimmering stars in a disarmingly tight 12' area. Bound to its western edge is a solitary 5.5 magni-tude sun. The less organized but charismatic groups of NGC 2345 and NGC 2374 are unveiled in low power flanking sweeps west and east of our target nebula. Two remaining clusters, Haffner 6 and Basel 11A, appear as small irregular splotches in the crowded Milky Way field. Both loom within a de-gree's distance of the warrior's headgear. A clear evening in either February or early March offers the best opportunity for re-cording Canis Major's showpieces. Planning a restive outing with your telescope almost certainly involves an honorary encounter with the Viking god's luminous crown. Amateur astronomers will find that, contrary to preconceived notions about relatively obscure emission nebulae, Thor's Helmet actually lives up to its reputation as a dra-matic "hidden treasure." Its hardened outline is perfect for those who collect odd galactic profiles and unusual shapes. (Aficionados should also look for IC 2118, the notorious Witch Head Nebula in Eridanus.) Thor's Helmet P NGC 2359 is an odd-shaped emission nebula found in the rich winter Milky Way. Known by astronomers as Thor's Helmet, this distant object was created by the fierce stellar wind of its central Wolf-Rayet star. The packed field has north to the left and west up.

Page 6 Seeing Deep Part I Perhaps you've seen this quote before: "You must not expect to see at sight...Seeing is some respects an art which must be learned. Many a night have I been practicing to see, and it would be strange if one did not acquire certain dexterity by such constant practice." Sir William Herschel wrote these words over two hundred and sixty years ago and they're just as true now. At first it may seem odd that it takes practice to see things well through a telescope because they're designed to makes things appear brighter, larger and easier to see. What's to learn? Remember when you learned to tie your shoes? Write your name? Ride a bicycle? Although we do these things without thinking now, at first they took a good deal of practice to master. But like any skill, with practice they became second nature and the same is true with learning to see through a telescope. This series of articles examines what it takes to see the faintest possible objects through any size tele-scope no matter where you observe. Before getting into specifics it's important to understand that it takes practice and patience to see as much as you're capable of and that there are no shortcuts. You can't hurry experience so relax, know that the learning curve will take time, and enjoy yourself as you learn to see deep. Dark adaptation n. The physical and chemical adjustments of the eye, including dilation of the pupil and increased activity of rods in the retina, that makes vision possible in relative darkness. (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dark+adaptation) The first thing you need to do when you want to observe deep sky objects is to make sure your eyes are dark adapted. All that means is that you allow your eyes to become accustomed to the darkness of night long enough that they are as sensitive as possible. This is a process your eyes go through every night when you're asleep. Have you ever gotten out of bed in the middle of the night and noticed how well you can see in your supposedly dark bedroom and wondered why that is? Your eyes dark adapted while you slept. As long as you don't expose your eyes to any bright lights it only takes about 30 minutes or so to be-come dark adapted when you're outside at a dark sky site. Fortunately, dark adaptation is barely dimin-ished by dim red light and that's why we use it when observing. Emphasis on "dim" though. A bright red light will diminish your dark adaptation almost as fast as an unfiltered light. So how does dark adaptation work? The first thing that happens is that your eye's pupils dilate to let in The Observer's Corner Howard Banich http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dark+adaptation ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 7 the most light as possible. At the same time, the light and color detecting parts of the eye – rods and cones - start adapting as well. Rods and cones are the two types of light sensitive elements in our eyes. Cones distinguish colors and work best in daylight, and are what we use when looking directly at something. They're most sensi-tive to the green light at 5600 angstroms and don't work very well at night. Ever notice that you can't see colors in the dark? Rods can't detect color but work best in low-light conditions, and are most sensitive to the blue-green light at 5100 angstroms. They are also excellent motion detectors in low light conditions. Rods make up the bulk of our peripheral vision and are what we use when trying to see a faint deep sky object. For additional information about rods and cones, and some nice graphics, check out: http:// www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/1G.html. If you're interested in finding out more about the physiological underpinnings of how our eyes detect light with Rhodopsin, otherwise known as Visual Purple, have at look at these two pages: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin. Although becoming fully dark adapted is cru-cial to seeing faint objects through your tele-scope, it isn't a skill per se. However, knowl-edge of how it works, how long it takes, and how to protect it throughout an observing ses-sion has a direct bearing on how well the pri-mary skill of averted vision can be used. Averted Vision Ok, so let's assume your eyes have become as dark adapted as they can, and you're ready to observe a faint object with your telescope. You've found its location but when you look in the eyepiece there are only a few stars visible. After double checking that your scope is pointing at exactly the right spot, it's now time to use the low light and motion sensitive rods in your eyes. Essentially, this involves paying attention to what you can see with the most sensitive portion of your peripheral vision. This is what we call averted vision. That means the faintest objects are counter-intuitively best seen when you look slightly away from them. Based on how the human eye is laid out, it works best for most people to place what they want to see somewhere between where their direct vision is looking – see the "look directly here" area in the diagram below - and their nose. We're all slightly different in exactly where the most sensitive area of http://www.buzzle.com/articles/dilated-pupils-causes.html http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/1G.html http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/1G.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin http://www.buzzle.com/articles/dilated-pupils-causes.html ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 our rods is located, so you'll have to discover your own sweet spot. For example, my averted vision sweet spot is essentially directly below my direct vision. As a side note, your blind spot, which is of no use for observing, is on the opposite side of your direct vision. You can investi-gate the properties of your blind spot at this interesting site: http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/ blindspot1.html Because our eyes are constantly shifting their gaze, you'll proba-bly discover your averted vision sweet spot in fits and starts as your eye moves around on its own. You can also do much the same thing by slowly rocking your scope back and forth. As your scope is moving it will stimulate the motion detection ability of your eye's rods, mo-mentarily letting you glimpse the object of your search as it moves into your averted vision sweet spot. A classic object to see the effects of averted vision is the Blinking Planetary, NGC 6826. When you look directly at it (cones) you see the central star. Look away slightly (rods) and the planetary nebula becomes visible. Switching back and forth between direct vision and averted vision makes the plane-tary nebula blink off and on, giving this nebula its memorable name. However, the same process works on all faint objects. In practice, your initial glimpse of a faint nebulosity may be uncertain at first glance, but with contin-ued application of averted vision it will soon become more obvious. Take your time, move the object around in your peripheral vision to find your sweet spot, and give yourself a good ten to fifteen minutes to get a taste of what averted vision can do. This isn't only for faint deep sky objects though, because when used on bright nebulous objects like M42 averted vision will show an amazing amount of fainter extensions. Averted Vision Scale There are levels of averted vision that describe how much effort was needed to see an object. Ron Morales of the Sonoran Desert Observatory developed a scale that's a useful way to describe how easy or difficult an object was to see (next page): This averted vision chart is for the left eye, and note that your sweet spot may be in a different spot than indicated. This is a DSS image of NGC 6337. http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/blindspot1.html http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/blindspot1.html ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 However, the sentence I've underlined in the AV5 section puzzles me. Unless you're intent on rediscover-ing objects on your own, there's no reason to not know their exact locations. More power to you if that's what you like to do, but for everyone else knowing the exact location, not to mention the size and surface brightness of a faint object is often essential to successfully seeing it. So I encourage you to use detailed charts and photographs to help pinpoint exactly where objects are located, as well as using them as guides to any potential details. Knowing where to concentrate your averted vision can make all the difference sometimes. Also, the size, surface brightness and physical nature of the object you're looking for will suggest the best range of magnifications to try, and the possible use of a filter. Doing a little research before observing will give you an idea of what's best for the objects on your observing list. If after giving it your best shot you're not sure you saw something, just note your uncertainty in your notes or make a mental note to yourself, and try again in the future. If you do think you saw something, you probably did, but knowing the exact loca-tion of the object will help you decide if you did see it. A rule of thumb is that three detections ("pops") within about five minutes count as a positive observation for a really faint object. However, the pops have to be strong sightings, even if they are fleeting. For threshold observations like this I like to test myself by trying to see the same thing in a different part of the field of view where I know there are no faint objects. If I see something there too then my eyes are playing tricks - and it's time to move on to brighter objects! Part II of this article will examine how to get the most from using averted vision, how to protect your dark adaptation while observing, and other important factors that contribute to seeing deep. Averted Vision Scale Developed by Ron Morales of the Sonoran Desert Observatory AV1 - Object can be seen with averted vision but once found, the object can occasionally be seen with direct vi-sion. If an object is first noticed with averted vision but once found this object can then be seen steadily with di-rect vision it is considered a direct vision object as opposed to an averted vision object. AV2 - Object can be seen only with averted vision but it is held steady. Here the sweep of one's vision makes the object detectable. AV3 - Object can only occasionally be seen with averted vision as it "comes & goes" with the seeing conditions. In this case the object is seen more than 50 % of the time. AV4 - Object can only occasionally be seen with averted vision as it "comes & goes" with the seeing conditions. In this case the object is seen less than 50 % of the time. AV5 - Object can only be glimpsed with averted vision after a continuously viewing the field for a few minutes or more. This level of averted vision usually occurs when one carefully observes a field for a lengthy period of time. This might occur within the first 3 to 5 minutes of viewing the field. In this level it is important that the observer has no knowledge of the exact location of a possible object. Having such knowledge prior to viewing could mis-lead some observers into believing that they saw something they did not actually see. One problem associated with viewing extremely faint galaxies it that sometimes an extremely faint star could be misidentified as an ex-tremely faint galaxy. For this level of averted vision it is suggested that the observer make a field sketch showing faint stars as well as the object in question. This field sketch can then, at a later time, be compared to an actual photograph or chart. At this level of detection are you seeing or just detecting the presence of an object. "We had no idea what these things were," recounted D. Andrew Howell, staff scientist at Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network and adjunct assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara. In 2006 and 2007, two objects caught by the detectors of the Supernova Legacy Survey looked like supernovae— stars exploding in cataclysmic stellar suicide—but did not act like familiar supernovae. Instead of brightening over a period of maybe three weeks (about 20 days), they seemed to take nearly three months (about 80 days). At first, no host galaxy could be found, so Howell and his colleagues didn't know "even whether they were supernovae or whether they were in our galaxy or a distant one." And when their visible light was spread out into a rainbow, their spectra revealed mysterious broad lines never seen before. Over the next year or so, a handful of similar objects discovered by the Palomar Transient Facto-ry and the Texas Super-nova Search revealed that they actually were in-credibly distant superno-vae—ones dating from beyond a redshift of z = 1, that is, more than half-way back to the Big Bang. The mysterious lines in the visible spec-tra were actually ultravi-olet emission redshift-ed—their short UV wavelengths expanded by the expanding uni-verse—into the longer visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Indeed, the supernovae were so distant that not only was light expanded in wavelength, but also time was dilated or expanded (per Einstein's theory of relativity). That time dilation stretched out the duration of the event so that, as seen from telescopes on Earth, the explosions seemed to unfold in slow motion. But another big mystery remained: how could those su-pernovae be so phenomenally brilliant? Power source? Supernovae are not alike. For decades, astronomers had known that supernovae fell into different types based on their light curves, that is, their pattern of rising and falling brightness. Later, they found these types actually corre-sponded to different physical circumstances triggering the explosions. Even those types have fine distinctions based on their spectra, giving rise to the categorization of supernovae by roman numerals, with sub-classes given lower-case let-ters. For example, Type Ia supernovae originate from white dwarfs in binary star systems, whereas Type II supernovae originate in an implosion-explosion event when a massive star's core collapses and the star blows off its outer layers. But the new supernovae did not correspond to any known type. Moreover, based on their distances, they had to be extraordinarily energetic. Their luminosity was roughly "10 times brighter than a thermonuclear [Type Ia] and 100 times brighter than a typical core-collapse supernova," state Howell and his 17 co-authors in a paper published in the December 20, 2013 issue of The Astrophysical Journal. For help in understanding the observations, Howell turned to computational astrophysicist Daniel Kasen, UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to see whether computer simulations could shed light on physics that could produce such unimaginable energies. Hydrogen-free superluminous? The simulations suggested that one object, designated SNLS 06D4eu, was "unlike a traditional core-collapse, ther-monuclear or interaction-powered supernova." Instead, it resembled an emerging class of supernovae classed as su-perluminous supernovae, a handful of which have been dis-covered. The data suggest a star originally 20 to 40 times more massive than the sun first blew off its outer hydrogen-rich layers. Then the dense naked core— still having a mass five times that of the sun and composed of carbon, oxygen, and other heavy elements—precipitously collapsed into a highly magnetized neutron star only tens of miles across, spinning hundreds of times per second, triggering the super-energetic explosion. In short, SNLS 06D4eu is one of a new sub-class of hydrogen-free superluminous supernovae. "As the most distant superluminous supernova with a spectrum (z = 1.588), SNLS 06D4eu provides a rare glimpse of the chemical composition and lightcurve evolu-tion of an early-universe supernova," write Howell and Kasen, and coauthors. It is also one of the most luminous supernovae known. Thus, they conclude, "it could be a relic of an earlier form of supernovae that is all but extinct to-day." "These are the dinosaurs of supernovae!" Howell ex-claimed. SNLS 06D4eu exploded before the sun was even born, when the universe was only 4 billion years old. "We were lucky to be pointing telescopes in the right direction when the photons hit Earth after their 10-billion-year jour-ney." –Trudy E.

Page 11 Old Tool, New Use: GPS and the Terrestrial Reference Frame By Alex H. Kasprak Flying over 1300 kilometers above Earth, the Jason 2 satellite knows its distance from the ocean down to a matter of centime-ters, allowing for the creation of detailed maps of the ocean's surface. This information is invaluable to oceanographers and cli-mate scientists. By understanding the ocean's complex topography—its barely perceptible hills and troughs—these scientists can monitor the pace of sea level rise, unravel the intricacies of ocean currents, and project the effects of future climate change. But these measurements would be useless if there were not some frame of reference to put them in context. A terrestrial refer-ence frame, ratified by an international group of scientists, serves that purpose. "It's a lot like air," says JPL scientist Jan Weiss. "It's all around us and is vitally important, but people don't really think about it." Creating such a frame of reference is more of a challenge than you might think, though. No point on the surface of Earth is truly fixed. To create a terrestrial reference frame, you need to know the distance between as many points as possible. Two methods help achieve that goal. Very-long baseline interferometry uses multiple radio antennas to monitor the signal from something very far away in space, like a quasar. The distance between the antennas can be calculated based on tiny changes in the time it takes the signal to reach them. Satellite laser ranging, the second method, bounces lasers off of satellites and measures the two-way travel time to calculate distance between ground stations. Weiss and his colleagues would like to add a third method into the mix—GPS. At the moment, GPS measurements are used only to tie together the points created by very long baseline interferometry and satellite laser ranging together, not to directly calculate a terrestrial reference frame. "There hasn't been a whole lot of serious effort to include GPS directly," says Weiss. His goal is to show that GPS can be used to create a terrestrial reference frame on its own. "The thing about GPS that's different from very-long baseline interferometry and satellite laser ranging is that you don't need complex and expensive infrastructure and can deploy many stations all around the world." Feeding GPS data directly into the calculation of a terrestrial reference frame could lead to an even more accurate and cost effec-tive way to reference points geospatially. This could be good news for missions like Jason 2. Slight errors in the terrestrial refer-ence frame can create significant errors where precise measurements are required. GPS stations could prove to be a vital and untapped resource in the quest to create the most accurate terrestrial reference frame possible. "The thing about GPS," says Weiss, "is that you are just so data rich when compared to these other techniques."

How can we give them the best chance to succeed? We can begin by researching how humanity has adapted to global environments in the last 50,000 years. Both biology and culture will evolve beyond Earth. Genetic studies tell us that we must be numerous and diverse in such migrations, and cultural anthropology shows that while we cannot predict precisely how humanity will change, we can be sure that it will, in universal concerns including how we measure kinship, our rules of inheritance, gender and age categories, and how we structure our families. There is plenty to consider. We might as well begin now. Bio: Dr. Cameron M. Smith of Portland State University's Department of Anthropology studies human evolution past, present and future. As a member of the international research group Icarus Insterstellar (icarusinterstellar.org), he is currently investigating the biological and cultural implications of multigenerational interstellar voyaging, recently authoring "Emigrating Beyond Earth: Human Adaptation and Space Colonization" (Springer 2012). Why? Because the increasing ease of space access, a generation and a half of human familiarity with traveling to space and living there, and the astounding discovery of thousands of exoplanets have all made thoughts of space colonization and even interstellar migration somewhat less outlandish than in the past.

He is currently writing a complimentary article on the cultural implications of such voyages, also for peer-reviewed publication, and a foundation book on the technical aspects of human space colonization, tentatively titled "Principles of Space Anthropology". Dr. Smith has also written extensively about space colonization and evolution for many magazines including Scientific American, Scientific American MIND, Spaceflight, and in the books "The Fact of Evolution" (Prometheus 2011) and "The Top Ten Myths About Evolution" (Prometheus 2006). He has lectured on human evolution in space colonization at the NASA-DARPA 100 Year Starship Study Conference in Houston, Texas and as a Plenary Speaker for the Mars Society. Dr. Smith's interest in the distant human future derives directly from his investigation of the distant human past, which beg an as a student of the Leakey research team searching for million-year-old hominin fossils in East Africa. Acutely aware that most civilizations have failed in the long term, resulting in dissolution, disintegration and essentially Medieval conditions, Dr. Smith has decided to provide options for humanity with realistic data on humans-in-space; space migration as a responsible investment for humanity, rather than a costly luxury.

An aura of duality, open spiral structure, and strong luminescence has made Messier 51 a popular stopover in spring skies. Observed and photographed countless times, the 8th-magnitude Whirlpool Galaxy is a familiar figure in scientific literature and throughout the world of astronomy. Positioning the telescope 3.6° southwest of the Big Dipper's handle star Alkaid reveals Messier's twinned treasure. The NGC cata-log calls them 5194 and 5195, high num-bered sequential listings in a compendium of almost 8000 deep-sky objects. Contemporary literature often lumps the two separate ob-jects together, referring to the dual condensa-tions as M51. The bulk of astronomical li-braries, however, discriminate between the single galaxies, applying only the M51 label to the big broadside system NGC 5194. Discovery came on the historical night of October 13, 1773. The French comet hunter Charles Messier documented a classic double nebula through his small telescope, devoid of any features and with touching "atmos-pheres." First hints of an iconic pinwheel form were recorded early in the 19th century by the British scientist Sir John Herschel, who saw a curious split ring structure. In actuality he observed several of M51's four existing concentric coils, drawing their in-complete outlines as simple circles. M51's magnificent whorled architecture was fully revealed in 1845 by the 3rd Earl of Rosse. He viewed a tantalizing amount of detail through his estate's huge 72-inch speculum mirror reflector, far exceeding the best observations of the time period. Across the broad glowing face and in the shaded recesses he saw "spiral convolutions" and noted that "the connection of the companion with the greater nebula is not to be doubted." Few galaxies in the heavens meld spiral architecture and companion objects so ex-travagantly. The larger "Whirlpool" system boasts an overall apparent diameter of 11' X 8' while its oblong neighbor, 4' 35" off to the north, measures just 5' X 4'. In brightness, M51 outshines its satellite galaxy NGC 5195 by several orders of magnitude. A premeditated approach for making your own critical observation requires thorough dark adaptation and transparent skies. Com-monly available 2.4- and 3-inch refractor telescope models affirm the double nature of the object but normally won't disclose any further detail. Among deep-sky hunters, it's widely acknowledged that the acclaimed geometry can be seen in a properly-tuned instrument of about 10-inches. However, larger light buckets are the venue of choice for capturing photograph-like vistas of the graceful arms and extended bridge. A big Dobsonian telescope transforms the major galaxy into a luminous cauldron of bluish-gray swirls, where the two most con-spicuous arms unwind clockwise toward the south and north. M51's dust laden bridge is a ghostly phenomenon. The slender causeway of light exhibits sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and is best viewed using averted vision. (Experts strongly warn about a sub-conscious influence from published images.) A peppered colony of field stars is scat-tered across the big spiral's disk. Shielded against easy detection by the mottled back-ground glow of the galaxy's hydrogen rich clouds, many of the suns are dim, hovering at around 14th-magnitude. At least ten standout luminaries emblazon the Whirlpool's inner halo and surrounding areas; a very obvious star is visible superimposed in the south-western quadrant between two curled arms. The distorted outline of NGC 5195 is the result of intense gravitational tugging from its more massive neighbor to the south. Re-search focused on their cosmology proves that the lesser galaxy is being severely dis-rupted by its giant Sc-type partner. Eons from today both galaxies may collide, trig-gering new rounds of star formation and a drastic change in their patterned appearance. NGC 5194 was the first island universe in which spiral structure was detected. The great astronomer William Henry Smyth viv-idly stated, "A stellar universe, similar to that which we belong, whose vast amplitudes are in no doubt peopled with countless numbers of percipient beings." The Whirlpool Galaxy, 25 million light years distant, commands considerable attention. Uncover its profound beauty this next spring with your telescope!

Page 5 Historical images are courtesy of the Royal Astronomical Society. JOHN FREDERICK WILLIAM HERSCHEL (March 7, 1792-May 11, 1871) was a great man of science. His contributions to the fields of mathematics, chemistry, botany, and astronomy are well-documented. Many of the Englishman's experiments are of historical importance, including innovative research into pho-tography and the polarizing properties of crystals. He excelled in all endeavors, but is best known for his careful studies of the heavens. John's reputation had a profound effect on intellectual society in Great Britain. Befriending many of the top people in government and industry, he was ultimately responsible for providing guidance and direction to London's hierarchy. A systematic study and cataloguing of celestial objects began in 1816 at his birthplace in Slough, England. John continued the meticulous astronomical meas-urements of his famous parent, which consisted of making zonal surveys and collating deep-sky information. A fascination with double star astrometry resulted in the detection of orbital movement and proof that Newton's law of gravitation worked far beyond the confines of the Solar System. A collaborator and close friend, James South (1785-1867), helped in the critical binary star study. John's stay at Slough was highly productive. He zealously determined the underlying properties of certain materials and eventually deduced the latent secrets of photography. In 1821, his bold mathematical contributions earned him the coveted Copley Medal of the Royal Society. Two important catalogues about astronomy were published during this time period. One contained precise data on some 2300 star clusters and nebulae. (The sketch of M51 was made during this era.) The other was a comprehensive six-volume set on binary star systems, carefully observed and then indexed according to equinoctial position. A graphical method was subsequently used to determine specific orbits. The Royal Society bestowed upon him its Gold Medal for the latter accomplishment. In the year 1834 he applied his vast astronomical expertise to the southern hemisphere. Embarking from England with his young wife, they traveled along with an odd assortment of telescopes to the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa. Lodging was at Feldhausen, a Dutch colonial home in the secluded shadow of Table Mountain. Skies were incredibly dark and relatively unexplored. John's four year stewardship produced phenomenal results. The ven-ture earned him another Copley Medal, and he documented thousands of foreign objects. Life in England resumed at Collingwood, the new family residence. Much of the data at Feldhausen was tabulated here. Later on, the extremely popular 700-page tome Outlines of Astronomy showed a masters' touch in editing. A break from science led to his appointment as Master of the Mint from 1850-1855. Symbols of John Herschel's power in astronomy are in evidence today. He suggested the permanent names of seven of Saturn's moons and four of the planet Uranus. Constellation reform, research into terrestrial magnetism and the in-vention of the actinometer are a few remaining highlights of his long and brilliant career. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

The Irish estate of Lord Rosse housed the "Leviathan," a monumental optical instrument with a 72-inch diameter mirror. A sketch of the Whirlpool Galaxy's famous spiral structure was recorded at the helm of the big reflector in 1850.

Page 7 Seeing Deep Part II Getting the most from Averted Vision Because dark adaptation and the effective use of averted vision are so sensitive, protecting them by using a faint red light while observ-ing is important. However, to maximize your use of averted vision you'll also want to prevent ambient light from entering your periph-eral vision while looking through the eyepiece. There's a surprising amount of ambient light at even the darkest lo-cations from starlight and airglow. Cupping your hands around the eyepiece, or using an observing hood or dark towel over your head can make a significant improvement while observing faint objects simply by blocking ambient light from getting into your eye. But using a dark towel or an observing hood when the relative humidity is high can be problematic be-cause they make it easier for your eyepiece to fog over by trapping your breath, which increases the humidity even more inside the hood or towel. However, if you observe in low humidity conditions this won't be a problem. The downside to using your hands cupped around the eyepiece is that it's difficult to fully protect your peripheral vision by cupping your hands around the eyepiece. It's usually better than nothing, but often not very satisfactory. My favorite way to block ambient light is with a Dethloff Eyepiece Shade (DES) which was designed by Chuck Dethloff several years ago. Made from a dollar store plastic salad bowl and a few pieces of thick black felt, it looks rather like a Darth Vader helmet with a hole in the top. A Paracorr or eyepiece fits through the hole of the DES, and the combo is inserted into the focuser so it's in place for the entire evening. It's easily rotated to account for any orientation of the scope. The DES works better than an ob-serving hood or towel for three reasons - the humidity from your breath can escape, your peripheral and direct vision are protected, and you're because looking into the DES – which is very black – instead of looking out of a hood or towel. To be clear, the DES doesn't prevent eyepieces from fog-ging up but it doesn't cause fogging like an observing hood The Observer's Corner Howard Banich ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 or a towel over your head can. However, it may be too large on small scopes so it's not for everyone. It also makes reach-ing the focusing knobs a little more difficult because you have to reach behind the DES. By the way, the photos show a DES on an 8 inch Newtonian. Protecting Dark Adaptation After taking all these precautions, how do you protect your dark adaptation while writing observing notes or drawing a sketch? Writing or sketching in true darkness isn't feasible so you'll need to use your faint red flashlight, but prolonged exposure to it might degrade your dark adaptation. One solu-tion is as straightforward as it is difficult to master – closing your observing eye while taking notes and sketching. You'll probably find this is much easier said than done, but once mastered is a valuable observing skill. Or use an observing patch - arrrgghh matey! Plus, you'll be all set for Talk like a Pirate Day on September 19th. A popular method of recording observation notes without need-ing a red flashlight is using a digital recorder. The downside is transcribing the recorded voice notes to more easily access them later. But this works great for many observers so you may want to give it a try. Some experienced observers have found that a dim light in non-red colors works better because they have trouble seeing star charts or writing notes in red light, but any color light has to be very dim indeed. A good rule of thumb is that the light should to be dim enough that you can barely tell what color it is. By the way, if you can see well enough to write or sketch at this low level of illumination you probably don't need to worry about losing your dark adaption. Another technique to protect your dark adaptation is to switch back and forth between both eyes every few minutes. The eye that's closed is dark adapting more deeply than if it were left open, and is ready for action when the other eye has lost its peak sensitivity. A related technique is to use one eye for observing deep sky objects and the other for planetary observ-ing. This also takes some getting used to, but dedicating one eye to dim objects and the other to bright objects allows you to observe both throughout an observing session without degrading either eye's ability to see them. Something else to be aware of is fatigue. You may find that after several minutes of intense averted vi-sion observing that you're not seeing as much as at first glance, and that's because the Rhodopsin (visual purple) in your observing eye is being photo bleached. Give your eyes a break – look up at the starry sky, chat with fellow observers, have a snack – or whatever - and then resume observing with refreshed vision. For maximum effect, keep your observing eye closed for the last few minutes of your break. Or as mentioned above, use an eye patch matey. Dethloff Eyepiece Shade with a 12 inch ruler for scale. For a surprising theory about why pirates may have worn eye patches, see: http:// mentalfloss.com/article/52493/why- -did-pirates-wear-eye-patches http://mentalfloss.com/article/52493/why-%20-did-pirates-wear-eye-patches http://mentalfloss.com/article/52493/why-%20-did-pirates-wear-eye-patches http://mentalfloss.com/article/52493/why-%20-did-pirates-wear-eye-patches ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 Although it takes 45 minutes for Rhodopsin to fully recover, in practice you'll find that a 10 minute break can be quite effective. For instance, it's not uncommon for me to take a last look at an object and seeing more after I'd just finished sketching, writing my notes and having a snack. Enhancing Averted Vision Although it may sound a little too easy, there's no better way to squeeze every faint detail from an ob-servation than making a sketch. A sketch doesn't have to be a masterpiece, but something as simple as a rough layout with a few notes goes a long way toward focusing your attention on the object you're observing. That's important because the more attention you give an object the more time you'll spend observing it and the more you're likely to see. Any type of sketching makes it a near certainty that you'll see more detail than you would have otherwise, thus maximizing your use of dark adaptation and averted vision. Sketching not only records what you've observed, it's also a tool that pushes you to see as much as you're able to. But there are few things more difficult than sketching in the dark, and getting results you find pleasing may feel like more trouble than it's worth for quite a while. But if you stick with it, compare your sketches of the same objects made a year or two apart. You'll be impressed by how much more you've learned to see. Comfort All the observing skill in the world will be compromised if you're not comfortable enough to observe for ten to fifteen minutes at a time so you can take full advantage of your dark adaptation and use of averted vision. Being comfortable means your attention isn't compromised by a twisted neck or aching back. Much of that and you'll start looking for a new hobby. An adjustable observing chair, or a sturdy ladder if you have a large Dob, go a long way toward insuring your comfort so you can concentrate on what you're seeing in the eyepiece. There are several models of adjustable observing chairs you can purchase and if you're handy it's not difficult to make your own, so don't put up with an uncomfortable observing setup because there are many reasonable solutions at hand. Search for "adjustable astronomy observing chair" on line and you'll find a surprisingly wide selection. If you have a large Dob, a three legged orchard ladder is far more stable than any four legged ladder, especially on uneven terrain. But even on a flat surface three legged ladders feel more secure. You may be wondering how three legs can possibly be more stable than four, but remember that a plane is defined by three points. That's why telescopes almost always have only three contact points with the ground. A four legged ladder can work well on a flat surface, but put it on uneven ground and you find out how unsteady it can be. That's the main reason orchard ladders have three instead of four legs. Another reason is that it's easier to place a three legged ladder closer to a tree or a big telescope. Heck, you can even order an astronomer orchard ladder with the steps 8 inches apart rather than the normal 12 inches.

Page 10 "Dress for Stargazing Success" Tony Flanders' article "Dress for Stargazing Success" in the December 2013 issue of Sky & Telescope magazine does a thorough job covering this important topic. Read Tony's excellent article and take his ad-vice. My philosophy is that it's always better to have too many warm clothes than too few. I like to joke that I'm prepared to ice fish at the North Pole, but really, that's not far from the truth. I should also note that as we age, we feel the cold more as we lose muscle mass, so what seemed like too many warm clothes in the past may be barely enough at some point. Add an extra set of thermals to your observing clothes bag so you're not caught short on some future beautifully clear but frightfully cold night. Snacks and Drinks Snacks and a refreshing drink help keep you func-tioning at a high level throughout an observing ses-sion. Staying away from high sugar snacks and drinks will help you avoid the roller coaster of sugar rushes and crashes, but of course this is an entirely personal preference. I've come to enjoy hot soup in a thermos, although you'll never see me turn down a cookie! Staying hydrated is also important, so water is highly recommended too. Coffee, tea, juice and soda are good for more than just hydration, but it's hard to beat plain water. Breathing And finally, breathing. It's surprisingly common to unconsciously hold your breath while concentrating on an observation, but doing so lowers the oxygen content in your blood stream and can diminish the sensitiv-ity of your vision. http://www.ehow.com/info_8320423_negative-effects-holding-breath.html Take a few deep, relaxing breaths before and during an observation to keep your blood oxygen level up. Also be careful to not make yourself dizzy by hyperventilating - slow and easy breaths are the way to go. Also, purposely exhaling away from the eyepiece will help insure that you don't fog up the field lens of your eyepiece by inadvertently breathing on it. Breathing out the side of your mouth, down and away from the eyepiece, is easy to do and can sometimes greatly prolong the time you can observe without having to de-fog your eyepiece. Of course, the warmer you can keep your eyepieces while not looking through them the longer they'll stay clear, but that's a topic for another day. The third and final part of this article will go through an example of how to integrate all the information and skills presented in the first two parts. I'll use an imaginary observing session to pull everything to-gether to show how you can see deep. http://www.ehow.com/info_8320423_negative-effects-holding-breath.html ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

Page 11 AGORA: Seeing the Invisible Elephant You know the familiar fable about the blind men trying to discern the nature of an elephant simply from feeling the animal with their hands: one at the side of the elephant thought it was like a wall, one at the trunk thought it was like a snake, and one at the tail thought it was like a rope. Each accurately perceived the elephant in part, but their tactile observations were inconsistent with one another. Astronomers are much in the same position in trying to discern the nature of the Universe. Most of the gravitating mass in the cosmos is cold dark matter—a slowly moving, weakly interacting elementary particle that holds together both individual galax-ies such as our own Milky Way as well as entire clusters of hundreds of galaxies. But humans are blind to it: dark matter does not emit light or other electromagnetic radiation. Thus, astrophysicists must rely on two tools to discern dark matter's nature: 1) observations of visible ordinary matter (w hich scientists call baryonic matter) that reveal dark matter's effects, and 2) supercomputer simulations to "reverse engineer" an d test ideas of how dark matter might interact with ordinary matter to form galaxies. Just one big problem: like the blind men studying only parts of the elephant but whose observational results are not consistent for the entire animal, astrophysicists have been able to model only parts of the universe because of limits to computational power. And the computer models have been inconsistent. Yet reproducibility is a fundamental principle of the scientific method: only if a result from an experiment can be independently reproduced by other scientists can it be regarded as robust. Now, a new ambitious multiyear international project AGORA is figuring out how to reveal the entire elephant—and also discern which of the inconsistencies are due to complexities of astrophysics versus computational issues. The challenge of scales One major challenge, for example, has been numerically modeling astrophysical processes over the vast range of size scales in the Universe—all the way from the formation of individual stars to the formation of galaxies to the formation of the cosmic web of large-scale structure in the cosmos. At small scales, computational models can calculate such details as shock waves from supernova explosions, turbulence, and chemical composition of gas and dust with a resolution (ability to discern details) the size of our solar system. At gigantic scales, cosmological simulations trace the evolution of the cosmic web in volumes hun-dreds of millions of lightyears across. At such scale, even the biggest supercomputers have been limited to handling just gravita-tional interactions of dark matter, if calculations are to be completed in reasonable time (months) and at affordable cost. And in the real Universe, both size scales interact: local star formation within individual galaxies is activated or quenched by the way galaxies "breathe" in and out the gaseous intergalactic medium. Often computational simulations do not create realist ic-looking galaxies with the right proportion of stars in the central bulge compared with the flat disk or the right amount of clumpi-ness. Major international collaboration Now supercomputers are starting to have the computational power to simulate large regions of the cosmos with sufficient resolution and realism to create galaxies that look like ones actually observed. AGORA—an ancient Greek word for meeting place, and an acronym for Assembling Galaxies of Resolved Anatomy—aims to understand and resolve inconsistencies revealed among simulations. AGORA got its start in a kick-off workshop at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in August 2012, under the sponsor-ship of the University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center (UC-HiPACC). A second workshop was held at UCSC in August 2013. AGORA, a collaboration of more than 90 astrophysicists and computational modelers in over 40 institutions in eight nations, is described in a flagship paper by Ji-hoon Kim and 45 co-authors that has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. The collaborators have set up methodology to compare and contrast the results with nine variants of differ-ent codes (programs for computer simulations), which numerically handle the physics and the computation in significantly dif-ferent ways. Although not the first comparison of supercomputer simulations of galaxy evolution, AGORA is the most compre-hensive and the highest-resolution (finest detail). The project is expected to be completed in 2015 and result in many papers. Stay tuned! –Trudy E.

All Rights Reserved. Page 12 On April 5, RCA members Kathy Kornei (above), Matt Vartanian and David Nemo volunteered at the 2014 Oregon Science Olympiad held at George Fox University. Kathy administered a test on the Solar System that she created for 21 Middle School teams. Matt was responsible for the High School Astronomy test for 14 teams. Teams partici-pated in a variety of tests during the day with the overall winning teams in the different school divisions qualifying for the National Science Olympiad to be held in Florida next month. Differences in supercomputer simulations to be compared in the AGORA project are clearly evident in this test gal-axy produced by each of nine different versions of partici-pating codes using the same astrophysics and starting with the same initial conditions. The goal of AGORA is to ana-lyze such differences to improve the realism and predictive power of supercomputer simulations, and thus astrono-mers' understanding of astrophysical processes.

If you are interested in volunteering for a single event or ongoing pro-gram, contact the RCA program director. If you have some time and skills but aren't sure where we need help, contact volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org and we'll find something for you to do. To learn about public outreach events and volunteer needs, check out upcoming events on the RCA Forum. We have begun an "Introduction to Astronomy" series of educational and instructional tutorials focused on basic astronomy, equipment and observing skills, geared towards beginners wanting to learn the fundamentals of astronomical observing and imaging. Series will be every-other month (alternating with New Member Orientation) in the OMSI Planetarium 6:30 - 7:15 p.m. pre-ceding General Membership Meeting (third Monday of month). Instructors will be RCA member-volunteers. Format will be interactive presentation and lots of time devoted to Q & A. The next tutorial "Introduction to Astro-Imaging" will be on June 16 @ 6:30 presented by Duncan Kitchin. Future topics will be based on feedback from New Member Orientation meetings and keeping our ears open to what new members and other beginners are asking about. http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/tmw.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/astroimage.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/cosmology.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/youth/youthAA.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/youth.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/downtowners.htm mailto:volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/forum/simple/index.php?board=40.0 http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/introastro.htm ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

Authentic models that were once mass-produced now occupy the shelves and display cases of secondhand establish-ments. All sizes and types are represented but the most common have single front lens openings of less than two inches. Pocket binoculars are defined as those with the smallest diameters, cumulatively restricted to between 15mm and 30mm in objective size.* Designed to fit into the palm of your hand, these little units are suitable for a wide range of outdoor leisure activities. As perfect traveling companions, they offer quick and simple peeks of the overhead universe. Bird watchers love them for their lightweight handling, while seafarers on occasion use them for celestial navigation. Mountaineering, nature expeditions and watching sports events are a few other spe-cialized uses. A variety of field, theater and sports glasses fall under this designation. A huge percentage of the vast stocks available in today's marketplace were manu-factured in Japan. Company marks abound on this popular optical product, and may include works by such acknowledged busi-ness masters as Fujinon, Canon, Kowa, Nip-pon Kogaku, Miyauchi, Pentax, Vixen, Olympus, and Takahashi. Numerous solo industries scattered throughout Japan have also tried their hand at binocular assembly, though their merchandise is somewhat less common in overseas shops. Germany has an especially long tradition of exporting super-quality binoculars. Carl Zeiss-Jena has been a reliable source of fine custom optics since 1846. Others, like Steiner, Hensoldt, and Leitz have also churned out many different models and types of equipment. However, because of the trend toward higher prices, these well-made units are often commercially exclusive. Familiar American brands such as Swift, Tasco, and Bushnell have exten-sive catalog placements, where entire pages are sometimes devoted to this single item. In the 1970 Tasco catalog, for instance, pocket glasses take center stage in the 40-page release. Priced be-tween $2.95 and $39.95, potential cus-tomers could choose from a varied se-lection that had such cute model names as "Chic," "Act One," and "Mascot." Sears offered comparable merchan-dise in its storewide catalogs. "Air-guide" sport and utility binoculars are favored in these technical recollections. Their caravan of affordable domestic and imported binocular products promised "added thrills" and "downright low prices." Each of their basic models has a soft leather carrying case and matching neck strap. Besides the distributors' name, every bin-ocular sold is stamped with a unique set of numeric data. Obvious to any owner is the magnifying power and aperture. Expressed as 10 X 25 or similar, these two crucial num-bers signify how close an object will appear and the relative brightness to expect. Almost always present is the linear value for the field of view. This number combination indicates in feet width the "angle spread" at 1,000 yards. For example, a pocket glass marked with "393FT/1000YDS" implies that Pocket Binoculars Versatility is a key feature of these little optical favorites. By John W. Siple N Top: A compact pair of boxed 3 X 28 artisan binoculars by Traq makes the perfect gift. Above: Czechoslovakia is the source of these relatively rare 4 X 20mm Meopta glasses.

Overlap between the different classes of binoculars is common. Normal hand-held models usually begin with a 30mm size, equal to the pocket glass upper range limit. the field of vision at 1,000 yards is 393 feet. This range measurement may also have a degree value, such as 7.1°. Serial numbers and international trade-marks are automatically placed on the body of the binocular. The firm's identifying sym-bol is very distinctive and can take many elaborate forms. Company artists showed their talent by drawing loops, curls, and other figurative characters in miniature. Bin-ocular insignia normally includes a dignified model name. Depending on the intended use, sales catalogs show a bevy of frivolous titles. Bushnell once had its representative "En-sign" and "Broadfield" models, while the more uncommon vintage Leitz 8 X 20's are called "Trinovids." There are only two prism styles in binocu-lar construction. Internally, the reflecting element may be either of Porro or roof-prism design. The latter technical strategy has a straight-line optical system and must be perfectly aligned for top performance. Bin-oculars that use Porro prisms are squatter in appearance. Those with fully coated BaK-4 (barium crown) optical glass prisms are the best, while cheaper off-the-shelf models are supplied with lesser grade BK-7 (borosili-cate) sets. Focusing may also be done in two clearly separate ways. Center focusing (C.F.), which is accomplished by turning a small wheel or dial between the eyepieces, is the most con-venient. Individual focusing (I.F.) is more elaborate and requires hand adjustment of each divided ocular. Bushnell's patented "Insta-Focus" mechanism is an ingenious off-shoot of center focusing. It works by pressing down on either side of a large rocker arm; images snap into focus quickly and conveniently. Non-stop shopping opportunities exist for individuals wishing to acquire a pre-owned set of binoculars. A regional walk-through of thrift stores and other money conscious es-tablishments has revealed a solid price range for older pocket glasses. Customers can ex-pect to pay anywhere between $5 and $30 for a used pair, irrespective of the point of manufacture. This monetary bracket includes some stunning models by select Japanese makers. One of the author's favorite finds is the $14 white pair of Tasco "Binocolors" (shown below) that was made more recently in Hong Kong. Secondhand stores have an obvious over-supply of Tasco and Bushnell models. Un-fortunately rare and very desirable glasses by Zeiss and other German makers were almost never seen; scouting upscale antique shops and online auctions are probably the best sources for finding these little beauties. Estate sales are another matter entirely. Expect anything in the way of binoculars at these widely attended events. A serendipi-tous stop at a professionally held sale gar-nered a nice pair of Meopta pocket binocu-lars for $10. Another visit resulted in the acquisition of an older pair of leather bound Turtle theater glasses. Comparable items are seen fairly regularly, and cash in at a surpris-ingly low $15. Undoubtedly the best bargain was a like new in the box Traq "Compact-28" sport glass. It was snapped up by the author for a paltry $4. Guidebooks on the general principles and use of binoculars are available in a variety of formats. In the particular field of astronomy, articles written by Phil Harrington are widely accepted as some of the best. Ad-vanced techniques for lunar observation are found in the tome Exploring the Moon Through Binoculars by Ernest H. Cherrington, Jr. One compelling book that also includes detailed tele-scope tours was written by noted astronomical colum-nist Alan M. MacRobert. In his wonderful guide Star-Hopping for Backyard As-tronomers, he has excel-lently organized chapters on binocular basics and high-lights a number of appro-priate deep-sky objects for each aperture class. Drawing praise from all collectors is Dr. Henry Paul's Binoculars and All-Purpose Telescopes. The author was a well-known telescope builder and binocular specialist during the 1960s and '70s. The 1980 soft cover edition, revised by Greg Stone, con-tains 96 pages of images plus many impor-tant charts and diagrams. Pocket binoculars are cheap and ubiqui-tous. Quite a few households have one or two pairs tucked away, ready for the next sporting or theatrical event. Popularity also runs high in nature study. The number of astronomical uses covers a broad swath too — nightly activities range from deep-space exploration, based on limited light grasp, to the local solar system, which involves zoom-ing to the Moon and beyond. With a fine selection, new and old glasses have played a major role in furthering the enjoyment of stereoscopic viewing. Combining the virtues of low cost and versatility, these little optical gems are great to own. Clockwise from top right: A vintage "Turtle" theater glass by Shinko Seisakusho. Bushnell's metal 6 X 25mm "Broadfield" binoculars are of especially solid construction. The durable Tasco 21mm model with its "triangle K" manufacturers' stamp has especially good optics and balance. The 7 X 25mm "Ensign" field glasses by Bushnell are also of great design, and carry the same proud trademark. All of the binocular photographs shown throughout this article are from the author.

To stage a deep-sky ex-ploration one might consider be-ginning at the Bowl of the Big Dipper, an easily identified naked-eye asterism of seven stars. This wide group contains a number of freewheeling galaxies plus one novel globe-shaped planetary nebula. If you're looking for a good challenge, the "Owl Nebula" is an ideal object to search out and study. Messier's famous watch list calls the round glow M97. Good fortune places it close to the 2nd-magnitude star Merak (β Ursae Majoris) at the southwestern corner of the Big Dipper's Bowl. This is one of the constellation's familiar Pointers, which di-rect skywatchers to the north celestial pole and Polaris. A slight shift 2½° southeast from Merak centers the planetary nebula in a low power ocular. The expanding shell of gas shines at magnitude 9.9 and has a diame-ter of 194", or just over four times the appar-ent size of Jupiter at favorable opposition. M97 is backed by considerable history. Shortly after its discovery on February 16, 1781, Pierre Méchain reported his find to astronomical colleague Charles Messier. After confirming its location, the newfound object was honored as the 97th entry in his premium deep-sky catalog. It was later resur-rected in Lord Rosse's fantastical drawing from 1848, which gave rise to the now famil-iar moniker. Less whimsical and more exact interpretations were made by 19th- and 20th-century astronomers, who after review saw a plain structure of gaseous construction. A silvery-gray surface with eminently pro-nounced "eyes," a halo of attractive field stars and a round fuzzy outline greets the potential observer. Applauding the visual process is the soft luminescence of M108, a cigar-shaped spiral galaxy that lies just 48' to the northwest. These two neighboring objects not only have conflicting shapes, but are also at radically different distances. A symbolic approach to recording the Owl's appearance is found in many pub-lished sketches. For example, in the 1978 hardcover edition of The Messier Album author John H. Mallas presents a slightly exaggerated but entirely plausible telescopic analysis. Although drawn using only a 4-inch model Unitron, it closely parallels the view through much larger professional in-struments. Modern day astronomical expert Stephen James O'Meara essentially mimics Mallas' observation in The Messier Objects, this time using a Tele Vue Genesis refractor from the clear skies of Hawaii for the accu-rate artwork. Each painting has properly placed adjacent oval patches and a gradual brightening at the nebula's center, demon-strating skill in telescope use. Other rendi-tions show slightly more internal detail, but still look much like the photograph below by the NOAO team sans color. The anticipated dark cavities can be somewhat of a disappointment in small tele-scopes. Limited light grasp combined with lack of deep-sky know-how has caused many individuals to miss the opportunity to see the eye-like features. In such cases only a grayish bland disk has been reported. Dis-cerning vague detail in low surface bright-ness planetary nebulae can be difficult at times, even for experienced observers. After examining the Owl, attention is often drawn to several nearby field stars. A 12th-magnitude star that sits 2.5' to the north-northeast is especially obvious. A few other anonymous stars surround the ball-shaped nebula, including one that is united with the blurry glow of an extremely remote 17th-magnitude galaxy. A skeptical footnote about a missing star inside one the dusky eyes is recorded in the writings of Rosse. As he told it, the supposed star on the north-western side of central bridge was seen in March of 1850. Five weeks later the tiny eye dot had mysteriously vanished, even though the telescope master pursued it "about forty times" during the next quarter of a century. Fueling the Owl's nebular glow is an evo-lutionarily advanced star of high temperature and density. The original solar powerhouse has shed its outer layers, creating a thin shell of expelled gas approximately 3 light-years in diameter. (The intense greenish color so often seen in long exposure photographs is the result of doubly ionized oxygen. Hydro-gen accounts for the peripheral ring of red-dish light.) A feeble output of photons and veil of nebulous material plus a 2,000 light-year distance has resulted in a difficult-to-detect 16th-magnitude object. People have been known to catch glimpses of the star in minor telescopes, but a 12-inch reflector is normally needed to get a positive sighting. In the distant realm of planetary nebulae, M97 (NGC 3587) ranks as one of the all-time best. It is not difficult for amateurs to see — deep-sky patriarch Walter Scott Hou-ston easily spied it through a pair of 15 X 65 binoculars.

Page 8 The Observer's Corner Howard Banich Seeing Deep Part III I presented a lot of information about dark adaptation, averted vision and how to get the most from them in the first two parts of this article. Not to mention observing com-fort, snacking, sketching and breathing. It probably came across somewhat like de-scribing how to juggle a chain saw, a bowling ball and an egg while standing on one leg, but fortunately seeing deep is easier to do than describe. In this third and final part I'm pulling everything together to illustrate how using the information previously discussed might look like when actually observing, and using a series of sketches to illustrate the power of well-used averted vision. This example portrays a relatively positive example to show why these skills are so widely used. However, it's not meant to suggest that this works equally well on every object every time. The variables of sky quality, your experience and skill along with the size and quality of your equipment will always be important, as is selecting targets that are within your range. The example: M51 Who wants a better view of M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy? Everyone, of course, which is one reason I've selected it for this imaginary observing session. The other reason is that you have a realistic chance of seeing more in this classic object regardless of what size scope you're using by developing your observing skills. As famous as M51 is, it isn't an easy object to see well from less than pristine skies, even with a large telescope. In this example we're imagining that you're observing from a place that would register about 20.0 to 21.0 with a Sky Quality Meter (SQM) and the faintest naked eye star might be around magnitude 5.5 to 6.0. In the Portland area, a place like Stub Stewart Park would fit the bill. Fairly dark, but the sky is still brightened somewhat by light pollution. In heavily light polluted skies M51 will always show less detail than you'd like it to, but that's not to say that good observing techniques are wasted under any conditions. Given the same atmospheric conditions, you'll always get more satisfying views from a darker location, which is why you're willing to drive an hour or so to observe under a darker sky than your backyard offers. That doesn't mean observing from home isn't worthwhile, only that you have set your expectations accordingly. Putting it all together Let's say you've practiced using averted vision techniques the last few times you've observed and feel like you're starting to get the hang of how to use and preserve it. Let's also say that you're out on a decent, but not great night with a few of your ob-serving buddies, your 12 inch scope is set up, complete with either a Dethloff Eyepiece ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 Shade (DES), observing hood or dark towel. You have plenty of warm clothes, snacks, something to drink, a notebook and an adjustable observing chair. And yes, you didn't forget your eyepieces like last time – you'll never do that again! You just measured how dark the sky is with your SQM and got a series of readings that average out to 20.75 - about average for this spot. You're ready to observe. You've been chatting with your buddies while setting up, and looking at a bright object like M5 and its Type II Cepheid's while your eyes become dark adapted. But now it's time to track down the number one object on your observing list tonight – M51, the iconic interacting galaxy pair in Canes Venatici. Finding M51 is fairly easy because of its location near the end of the Big Dipper's handle, plus it shows up in your finder scope as a small fuzzy spot. Looking through the main scope, you center the surprisingly small, soft double glow in your low power eyepiece (somewhere in the 40x to 75x range) and see the two galactic cores, NGC's 5194 and 5195. But where are the spiral arms? There's a faint, round mist around one of the two galactic cores, which must be the spiral arms of NGC 5194. Your first thought is that this is about all you saw last year when you observed M51 for the first time. The sky is fairly transparent though, and it seems pretty dark so what the heck, you'll keep observing and use your new averted vision and other observing techniques to find out just how much of M51 you really can see. You put a medium power eyepiece (somewhere in the 100x to 150x range) in the focuser, being care-ful to not ruin your dark adaptation with your red flashlight, and then reach for the focuser.... Rats, the eyepiece is now too far away to sit comfortably in your observing chair while looking through the eyepiece, so you quickly move it to enjoy the view for a good long look. "No need to give myself a sore back". Going Deep Back at the eyepiece, and almost without thinking about it, you try averted vision and see... something more. Is that a bit of spiral arm? "Hey, this is cool!" you say softly to yourself, while continuing to look with averted vision. You also notice that holding M51 in your averted vision sweet spot takes effort be-cause your gaze seems to wander all over the field of view. What's this? It looks like there is more than one bit of the spiral arms visible now, plus there's a faint star within the spiral arms that you hadn't noticed at low power. The thought it be a supernova runs through your thoughts but conclude "I'll have to check that online later." Oddly, the spiral arms now look like a ring which reminds you of John Herschel's sketch from the early 1800's. Deeper You keep observing, breathing regularly, exhaling away from the eyepiece and decide to try a little more magnification (somewhere in the 190x to 250x range). And what the heck, you'll start a sketch to see if it really does help pull out more detail. While changing the eyepiece you again keep your observing eye closed to help preserve ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 its dark adaptation. After refocusing, you automatically start observing with averted vision, and once you have M51 in your sweet spot, you see the spiral arms don't look like a ring after all, but have a definite spiral shape. But you wonder "am I seeing the spiral shape because I know it's there? Would I have thought they were a ring like the Herschel's if I hadn't seen photos show-ing the spiral arms?" After a moment's pause you decide there's no way to know now and begin your sketch. You start by plotting the locations of the two galactic cores in your notebook, go-ing back and forth between the eyepiece and your sketch several times to make sure you've got them plotted fairly well in your notebook. It's difficult to keep your observing eye closed while sketching, but you remind yourself that you're trying to preserve as much of your dark adaptation as possible. It's not easy but you keep at it. You also plot a nearby field star on your sketch. After getting the general layout of your sketch onto paper you take a couple of relaxing, deep breaths and place M51 in your averted vision sweet spot, and in a flash that's as exciting as it was brief, you clearly see the two main spiral arms. A quick glance with direct vision makes the arms disappear, but that's ok, averted vision brings them right back. You excitedly add them to your sketch. Deeper still... Then you slowly move your scope back and forth, utilizing the motion detecting ability of your dark adapted eyes, and see that the slowly moving view makes it slightly easier to see the spiral arms. You also notice that the arm extending toward NGC 5195, the smaller galaxy, seems to almost connect the two – the famous "bridge". But you decide after careful examination that you're not seeing the entire bridge, there's a portion that's a bit too faint to see. Plus, you've noticed that NGC 5195 has an elongated shape. "Hmm, looks like it points right at the core of the Whirlpool..." You've also noticed that the spiral arm that wraps between the cores of NGC 5194 and 5195 isn't a smooth curve but bends at an nearly 90 degree angle. You add all this to your sketch, careful to protect your dark adaptation, and then note that a few more faint stars have become visible. You also notice that you need to adjust the proportions of the spiral arms to get them looking more like what you're seeing in the eyepiece. Then you notice that you need to adjust your observing chair again and wonder "how long have I been ob-serving to have to move my chair again?" While moving your chair you decide you'd rather look in the eyepiece rather than at your watch, and to also try more magnification to see if more power reveals addi-tional details. But you quickly decide the more satisfying view is back at the previous magnification even though it was easier see the faint stars in and around M51 at the higher power. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 After observing for what turns out to be another 15 minutes you notice that you're not seeing as much as you had previously, and your eyes feel a little tired. "This must be what happens when the Visual Purple in my observing eye starts to bleach out" so you write a few notes to go with your sketch. At this point the thought of using an eye patch seems a lot more attractive and you add a final line in your notes to look into getting one before your next observing ses-sion. "Got to be easier than keeping one eye closed..." Finished with your notes, you decide it's time to celebrate your great observation with a snack and something to drink. Real-izing you're getting cold, you head for your car to get the extra layers of clothes and some hand warmers you brought along. Deep as you can go - for tonight. After zipping up your heavy coat and putting a handwarmer inside each glove, you take a last look at M51 before moving on to your next object – and stop the presses, the connecting arm does seem to reach all the way to NGC 5195 now! Yes! Ah, but you can't duplicate that instant impression of the seeing the entire bridge, even though it looked like it was there for a moment. Intrigued, you keep looking, hoping another moment of clarity will bring the complete bridge into view again, but no luck, at least not tonight. You wonder if your impression was an optical illusion, or if for just a moment you really did perceive the entire length of the bridge. There's no way to know and decide you won't count your one impression as a definite observation. But you're pretty sure that in a darker sky you'd be able to see the entire bridge. Even so you just have to share this great view of M51 and you holler to your buddies "you guys just have to see M51 over here in my scope!" At least one guy can't tear himself away from whatever he's looking at, one won't see as much as you have because he'll look for only a minute or two through your scope, and the third will see everything you did and maybe a bit more - but then she's been an observer for 30 years and always sees more than anyone else. At least one of them will then head back to their own scope to find out how much of M51 they can see with their own equipment. Whether they end up seeing as much as you have depends on all the same variables you've just dealt with, but regardless of what they see you're satisfied not only with the awesome view you've just enjoyed but also with your increasingly powerful observing skills. Feeling energized, you move on to your next object and end up having a fabulous night of observing. The next day at home you look at your sketch and clean up the stray lines, erase a few smudges and tighten up the squiggles that were supposed to be stars. After scanning your final sketch you invert it using GIMP ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 or Photoshop so it looks more like what you saw last night through your scope. "Not bad!" you think, "maybe I'll post it on Cloudy Nights later..." But before going online, you look up your M51 observations from last year and can barely believe how little you saw using the same scope from the same place. "How about that" you mut-ter to yourself, "So that's what Herschel meant by ' You must not expect to see at sight." The Mass of Life By: G. E. Austin, RCA Student Member The Higgs Boson, first theorized in 1964, is the evasive particle of the century and a fundamental component to our existence. Though Peter Higgs, Francois Englert and others predicted its existence in 1964, scientists did not receive their first glimpse of this long-sought particle until 2012. Scientists world-wide worked together to operate the 17 mile long Large Hadron (particle) Collider (LHC) at CERN, the world's largest particle physics laboratory, that staged this fateful glimpse. On July 4, 2012, scientists observed unknown particles in the collider believed to be the Higgs Boson. When the particles were confirmed to be the Higgs Boson in March 2013, the world burst into applause. One reason the Higgs Boson eluded scientists for so many decades is that it decays in a matter of milliseconds before scientists are able to identify it. Often, it decays into quarks (fundamental particles that make up all basic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons). Quarks are commonly found in the LHC so when a Higgs Boson decays into quarks, the particles are lost in a sea of identical quarks. It's like trying to distinguish one candle from another on the birthday cake of the Methu selah bristle cone pine tree (almost 4800 years old!). It's impossible to tell one candle from another. Thankfully, the boson decays into other particles as well. One in one thousand times, the Higgs decays into two photons. Photons are different from quarks in that they have differing energy levels from each other. In the LHC, the photons emitted have different energy levels from other sources of the same kind. The Higgs' photons protruded off this curve thus making it possible for scientists to identify these photons as the products of the Higgs Boson decay. Much like a photon is a carrier of light for the electromagnetic field, the Higgs Boson carries the Higgs Field to other particles. The Higgs Field works to exaggerate the mass of particles, allowing them to slow enough to combine with other particles and form more complicated structures such as atoms, molecules, cells, stars and even human beings. The field acts as the glue of the cosmos. Let's say we have an endless number of little pieces of paper sliding on a sheet of cardboard in a kindergarten art class. There is nothing to stop the pieces from sliding around. Only when the teacher adds glue do the pieces of paper stay in a fixed spot creating an image of a star or a human being. The same applies to the universe. Without the Higgs Field, the universe would be a jumbled mess of particles, endlessly floating without the ability to assemble and create actual stars and human beings. While we know more about the Higgs Boson, Higgs Field, our universe and even ourselves with this discovery, unanswered questions remain. Each breakthrough leads to more questions and the pursuit for knowledge continues.

Monday June 16th Intro to Astronomy Begins: 6:30 pm. Location: OMSI Planetarium General Meeting 7:30 pm. Location: OMSI Auditorium ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers All Rights Reserved. Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Jun 12 First Quarter Moon Jun 05 Last Quarter Moon Jun 19 New Moon Jun 27 Donald Edward Machholz is the most successful living visual comet hunter in the United States, being credited with the discovery of 11 comets, including the periodic comets 96P/Machholz, 141P/Machholz, the non-periodic C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) that was easily visible in binoculars in the northern sky in 2004 and 2005, and most recently, C/2010 F4 (Machholz). Machholz is also considered to be one of the inventors of the Messier marathon, which is a race to observe all the Messier objects in a single night. It was 33 years ago that he decided to pursue a systematic search for comets. This decision came at a pivotal time in his life. He had just finished serving three years in the military, had moved back home, and he wanted a project that would encourage him to spend more time viewing the heavens. Over the previous decade he spent considerable time viewing all the planets and a half-dozen comets, found every Messier Object in one year (1969-70), and photographed the skies. He has always enjoyed the view of the night sky through the telescope. The projects that he considered were: variable stars, asteroid studies, and comet hunting. Comet hunting seemed most appealing to him. He also knew that very few Americans were searching for comets, because most visual discoveries were being made from foreign lands. According to James Muirden ("The Amateur Astronomer's Handbook"), the average comet hunter took 300 hours to find a new comet. This was confirmed to him when he read an interview with William Bradfield appearing in the magazine Eclipse. There he said his first discovery took 260 hours and his second took an additional 306 hours. Don's early philosophy developed: he would attempt systematic comet hunting for as long as he found it enjoyable. If he did not find it enjoyable, he could quit my comet hunting program and move on to something else, his only "loss" being the time spent looking through the telescope. And if he enjoyed it, he'd continue his comet hunting program. Finally, he wanted his comet hunting program, as extensive as it might become, to be only a part of his life, not to consume it. He did not want to exclude other activities or people from his life just because he wanted to hunt comets.

Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Aug 10 First Quarter Moon Aug 03 Last Quarter Moon Jul 19 New Moon Jul 26 On July 14th 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraf t wi l l make the f i r s t -ever encounter with Pluto, its giant moon Charon, and ret inue of four smaller satellites. The Pluto system is unlike any place previously explored, and promises a harvest of spectacular discoveries. I will discuss the many remarkable things that we already know about the Pluto system, the long journey of New Horizons from conception to the launchpad and to Pluto and beyond, and how we will use the s p a c e c r a f t t o r e v o l u t i o n i z e o u r understanding of Pluto and its surroundings. John Spencer is an Institute Scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and a member of the New Horizons science team. A native of England, he obtained his PhD in Planetary Sciences from the University of Arizona in 1987, and has since worked at the University of Hawaii and at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona (where Pluto was discovered) before joining Southwest Research Institute in 2004. He studies the moons and other small bodies of the outer solar system using ground-based telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope, and close-up spacecraft observations. He was a science team member on the Galileo Jupiter orbiter and continues to work on the science team of the Cassini Saturn orbiter. Among other work, he was involved in the discovery of current activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus, solving the mystery of the black-and-white appearance of Saturn's moon Iapetus, and the discovery of oxygen on the surfaces of Jupiter's icy moons.

If you are interested in volunteering for a single event or ongoing pro-gram, contact the RCA program director. If you have some time and skills but aren't sure where we need help, contact volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org and we'll find something for you to do. To learn about public outreach events and volunteer needs, check out upcoming events on the RCA Forum. We have begun an "Introduction to Astronomy" series of educational and instructional tutorials focused on basic astronomy, equipment and observing skills, geared towards beginners wanting to learn the fundamentals of astronomical observing and imaging. Series will be every-other month (alternating with New Member Orientation) in the OMSI Planetarium 6:30 - 7:15 p.m. pre-ceding General Membership Meeting (third Monday of month). Instructors will be RCA member-volunteers. Format will be interactive presentation and lots of time devoted to Q & A. Future topics will be based on feedback from New Member Orientation meetings and keeping our ears open to what new members and other beginners are asking about. Please let David Nemo or Howard Knytych (email on page 3) of interest in any topic. http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/tmw.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/astroimage.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/cosmology.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/youth/youthAA.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/youth.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/new_members.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/downtowners.htm mailto:volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/forum/simple/index.php?board=40.0 http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/introastro.htm ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

Star-gazers can't afford to miss the prized binoculars that once belonged to their par-ents and relatives. Purchased during the last 20th century for sometimes hefty prices, these legendary "binocs" are liked by collec-tors and experts in astronomy for their preci-sion lenses, molded construction, and fancy eyepiece adjustments. Public offerings of classic binoculars rule the hobby of astronomy. A quick look at rival catalogs reveals a commercial indul-gence of different models. Ordinary 7 X 35s are very common and, arguably, the cheap-est, best values available in secondhand equipment. Larger 7 X 50s and stronger powered versions are also standard to the canon of past advertisements. Imported Bushnell, Bausch & Lomb, Tasco, and Sears binoculars are readily available and form the core of most collec-tions. Following closely are fine works by SPI, Sans & Streiffe, Swift, Selsi, and Jason. Yet unusual finds do happen, and can in-clude noteworthy examples from Zeiss, Nip-pon Kogaku (Nikon), Sard, and Steiner. An important aspect of binocular acquisi-tion is provenance or where the item origi-nated. Almost all older discontinued brands say either "Japan," "Made in Japan," or in-frequently "Made in Occupied Japan." Buy-ing sprees may also earn a few German glasses, good bets when trained on the stars. Broadening the appeal of collecting are those with atypical zoom, ultra-wide angle and rubber armored features. Unless documented as an especially valu-able collectible, secondhand binoculars bring about $10 to $35 at local auctions and neighborhood estate sales; alternate garage, rummage and moving sales, attended by households with limited funds and other bargain seekers, offer merchandise at or below prevailing rates. Browsing thrift and antique stores is also an easy way to unearth cheap, pre-owned pairs. Surprisingly, astronomical grade bin-oculars in 60mm sizes and up are almost never encountered when stalking these yard sales and resale shops. Of course, people that wish to hunt by personal computer have online auctions and Craigslist advertisements as resources. With vintage binoculars, flawless condi-tion is a luxury. Buyers are cautioned to look for obvious defects and wear. An appropriate checklist should include the following items: missing parts, inability to focus, worn enamel or lettering, faded lens coatings, dents, and mildew from long term storage in outbuildings. Misalignment in the form of distorted images is quite common and results from sudden jarring and rough use. Mint condition glasses draw covetous attention. Handled with extreme care for generations, they are free of any noticeable signs of damage. The top-quality 9 X 35 bin-ocular shown at far left was economically priced at $15. It has fully coated optics and a wide, evenly illuminated 7.3° field of view. Because of its low cost, ultra-sharp images and custom design, the B & L "Discoverer" remains the author's unofficial favorite and best overall find. Top-ranking pairs by brand name compa-nies unquestionably offer the clearest views. Satisfying any critic are those binoculars from Nikon. The vintage Nippon Kogaku 8 X 30 field glass (center photo) was pur-chased by its previous owner when stationed in the military overseas. It fetched a rela-tively steep $100 when discovered at a local consignment store. Performance evaluation on the night sky is extravagant while its sleek design makes for effortless handling. Another guarded treasure is the circa 1972 7X-15X35mm "Statesman" zoom binocular by Jason. The desirable item (below with receipt) is decorated with multiple decals and stickers. Found hanging in an everyday junk shop, it was tagged at less than half the new cost. Similar high-end models were sold by many of Jason's competitors. Tasco's 1973 catalog, for instance, lists a comparable zoom edition for $99.95. In the marketplace, pricing schemes in-volving classic merchandise are completely haphazard. The whims of the seller com-bined with ardent negotiation frequently dictate the final asking price. This can result in arbitrary and widely fluctuating values for the same kind of memorabilia, regardless of condition. This was demonstrated in the purchase of several pairs of Bushnell 10 X 50 "Insta-Focus" binoculars. They varied in cost from $9 to $30, but had no apparent difference in performance. Binocular Ownership Used models are easy to acquire. By John W. Siple S Page 5©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. A bonus for collectors is the Nikon 8 X 30 binocular shown above. Its practical design and great optics are unbeatable for astronomy. A slightly more economical glass from Jason (right) was made decades later and has an additional fingertip zoom adjustment. Bausch & Lomb Co. is the market source for this outstanding pair of 9 X 35 binoculars. The modest opportunities gained from shopping bargain outlets allow large quanti-ties of used optical goods to accumulate. A comprehensive group of over two dozen binocular specimens were personally ac-quired by attending resale events. Most glasses were made in the 1960s and '70s, although a few date from the 1950s. In the practical 7 X 35 category, important achievements include hand-held models that are marked Ranger, Daylight, Jewel, Mer-cury, Taylor, and Three Star. Breakthrough finds in the slightly smaller 30mm "general use" category are those from Wray (Eng-land), Atlas, and a 1930's Zeiss "Deltrintem" pair with full provenance. Binoculars with 50mm lenses, true "night glasses" possessing powers of 7X or 10X, have alphabetical inventories of Binolux, Manon, Omega, Optex, Optica, and Tower. Speaking of mag-nification, several 20X models were also located by the author — Swift's Model No. 788 is the best grade yet discovered. Surplus glasses from a variety of contrac-tors flooded the market immediately after the end of World War II. Built to take extremely rough handling in outdoor use, these often weigh 45 ounces or more. The military or Magna 10 X 50 was found hidden in the bric-a-brac at a crowded estate sale. A trademark search shows that it was made by the Tokyo Optical Co., Ltd. Representative samples from J.C. Penney, Wards, Kmart (Focal), Sears, and Tasco are surprisingly common. If these fit your needs, then a trip to the pages of an older catalog is recommended. Inside, series of telescopes, microscopes and binoculars intersect and fiercely compete for the customer's atten-tion. Binoculars have a major presence and offer solid values and innovation. Back in the 1970s, a customer could buy a nice pair of standard angle 35mm binoculars for around $20. Fancier units show a jump in price, growing from a base sum of twenty dollars to well over $100. Prism binoculars with larger 50mm lenses augment the picto-rial ads and effectively peak at the same general price level. In the 1976 Spring and Summer catalog, Wards had its super-wide angle 7 X 35 model listed at $44.50. Their two optional manual zoom versions with center wheel focusing have $54 and $69 individual costs, depending on the power range and field of view desired. The clients' selection extended to dual 7 X 50s and 10 X 50s, essential glasses for astronomy. These, according to the literature, give "sharp images in low light." Showcased at $34.50 and $38.50, both binoculars possess basic features only. The future collector can get some neces-sary shopping tips by glancing at one of Tasco's period catalogs. Established in 1954, the company's many illus-trated layouts have be-come an iconic reference source for astronomers and researchers. Of the approximately 40 or so binocular products dis-played annually, you can find listings for such best-sellers as their "Aca-pulco," "Seville," and all-pro "Touchdown" models. In the 1973 catalog in-stallment most of Tasco's 35mm glasses fall between $30 and $100, with one electric zoom advertised at a whopping $150. Several unusual items are also shown in Tasco's wonderful gallery of opti-cal products. A featured piece is their #490 roof prism 8 X 56 binocular, which was priced at $120 during most of the early 1970s. It is described as "a powerhouse binocular with extra bright images due to the king size 56mm objective lenses," while its unique "new straight-line optical system permits a sleek, slim silhou-ette design." Among the leaders in industry is Sears, Roebuck & Co., a firm renowned for its diverse selection of merchandise. Through-out its long business reign, the Chicago-based retail giant supplied the amateur as-tronomer and naturalist with various types of hand-held binoculars. Fittingly, they offered a legion of models that "bring the action up close and clearly." (Illustrated above is a 7X-16X35mm zoom with am-ber coated optics.) A representative look at the company's 1983 Fall and Winter sales catalog has a 40mm wide angle unit for $60 — the more mechanically distinctive 10 to 25X zoom model with a 50mm lens was earmarked higher at $130. Popular alternatives in their literature are shown all during the 1960s and '70s. Foremost on any col-lector's list are Tower pre-cision binoculars that were imported directly from France. This custom Sears item came in multiple sizes and powers; featherweight versions were available at substantially greater cost. Kmart and J.C. Penney have similar but smaller inventories of night vision products. They follow a common pattern in optical sales — their merchandise came from the same host suppliers in Japan. This is clearly seen in the two 7 X 35 models from Mercury and Taylor, where only slight differences appear. Every binocular sold has a matching carrying case. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 6 A zoom binocular that was available from Sears, Roebuck and Company. Right: Mercury and Taylor brand 7 X 35 binoculars have similar construction and optics. The war surplus Magna 10 X 50 field glass from Japan (above, left) is of extra durable design. Unless otherwise noted, all images are by the author. These are considered primary accessory items and come in a wide range of functional styles. Depending on the cost, materials can be either vinyl or leather — colors are usu-ally limited to plain black and various shades of brown and red. Cheaper models are fabricated out of imi-tation leather or reinforced plastic. Soft zip-per pouches with wrist straps are made for smaller units only. At the forefront of graphic design are V-cut split leather cases with plush velvet-lined interiors. Almost standard on vintage field models, they impart an antique look and raise the market appeal. Bushnell embellished their precision bin-oculars with a simple, nearly square case. Black vinyl is the usual construction material but there are transitions to other colors, fab-rics and rectangular shapes. The company decided to keep the same sports case for its Taiwanese and Korean-made glasses. The Johnston & Finch extra-wide angle (10.1° FOV) 7 X 35 binocular with rubber "bumper" rims is housed in a finely-tooled leather case. An inside barrier of soft red cloth prevents rubbing and unsightly scuff marks. This particular item — another of the author's favorites — was priced at $20 when picked out of the clutter at a professionally-held estate sale. About 30 percent of the binoculars pre-sented in this article are missing their origi-nal protective cases. This is a common oc-currence with pre-owned equipment and can result in a confusing "mix-and-match" phi-losophy. Lost lens caps are another casualty of time. Through absentminded storage these little plastic covers can disappear singly or in sets, but can be replaced with inexpensive substitutes. Vanished eyecups and objective rims are far less a problem but still detract from the cosmetic value. Another indispensable source for gaining knowledge about certain binoculars is lo-cated in the back issues of Sky & Telescope and Astronomy magazines. Over their long reign, a seemingly unlimited number of ne-cessities for the amateur astronomer have miraculously appeared. Monthly specials from Zeiss, Nikon, and Bushnell are regu-larly incorporated into camera store market guides, while accompanying pages have solicitations from such long standing entities as Celestron, Orion, Edmund, and Meade. A random chronology reveals an imposing number of enterprising firms. Lafayette Elec-tronics had a well-earned reputation for sell-ing binoculars and small refractor telescopes during the 1950s and '60s. Meanwhile, Jae-gers of Lynbrook, N.Y. promoted its preci-sion-made night glasses at "low, low prices!" A glance at the May 1981 issue of Sky & Telescope reveals an interesting combination of generic goods. Swift has a giant 11 X 80 comet hunting binocular, while R.V.R. Opti-cal stocked "every size and style, including special Giant 6" Models — the absolute ultimate for comets and spectacular wide-field observation." These larger units pose a real challenge for the bargain sleuth. Most non-astronomical suppliers focus their attention toward sports events and daily nature studies where light-gathering power isn't as impor-tant. A cutoff point seems to be about 50mm. A higher initial cost plus other considera-tions make them a scarce sight at yard sale tables. Other than a contemporary Barska 15 X 70 glass, the author's only other discovery of significance in this category has been a die-cast aluminum Tasco #316 "Super Spot-ter" 20 X 60mm, which was purchased from an antique dealership. A lifetime obsession with astronomy and science has led many people to the world of stereoscopic viewing. Temperance is not an option in binocular ownership, since quality used glasses are so cheap and plentiful. For less than $30 per item, the average person can acquire a suitable collection of binocu-lar-related paraphernalia for investment and astronomical enjoyment. Token treasures can extend to telescopes and other optical items, paving the way to further collections and stargazing activities. Most successful transactions require some sort of familiarity with binocular history — this knowledge adds to the fun of the hobby and can be passed down to offspring and friends. Traveling a few miles in either direc-tion from home brings the individual to a promising number of bargain spots. Every-one enjoys looking at the tables and shelves full of trinkets and gently used merchandise. Given the opportunity, chances are very good of securing your own great glass from the 1960s and '70s. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 7 Some harder-to-find items: A Remington 9 X 20 pocket glass (far left) is dwarfed in size by the Sears 35mm rubber-coated binocular at center. A military surplus monocular (right) adds variety to collecting. The maple bookcase below holds numerous finds from estate and garage sales. Dr. Henry Paul's popular book Binoculars and All-Purpose Telescopes is shown on the top shelf. This Johnston & Finch binocular is supplied with a custom leather case. About once a century in any galaxy, a star spontaneously explodes—so brilliant that for a few days it can outshine all other stars in a small home galaxy. Although frequent by cosmic standards, supernovae are rare in human terms: since the invention of the telescope, none has been seen to explode in our Milky Way. So how can astronomers study such catastrophic stellar suicides, especially the hours immediately after ignition? Answer: Partner two automated telescopes with real-time supercomputing to monitor tens of thousands of galax-ies every night, so that statistically there's a high chance of spotting a star exploding in some galaxy. "Just since April 2009, we've discovered over 1,300 supernovae!" exclaimed Peter Nugent, senior staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and principal investigator of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) Type Ia supernova program (supernovae come in different types). How it works Atop Palomar Mountain, the Samuel Oschin telescope— a 48-inch (1.2-meter) Schmidt—acts as an automated wide-field survey camera, snapping sequential exposures of 8 square degrees across the night sky. Each minute or so, its sensitive CCD 101-megapixel sensor array records stars and galaxies as faint as 20th magnitude. Each digital image is instantly beamed to the San Diego Supercomputing Center at the University of California, San Diego, and then 400+ miles north to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Law-rence Berkeley National Laboratory. Within minutes, super-computers subtract each incoming image from reference images, comparing new sources of light to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and other databases. "We collect about 50 gigabyes of raw data per night," Nugent says, "and typically discover about a million things that vary. The vast majority of them are 'garbage'—known variable stars, asteroids, etc. But one or two per night are young supernovae!" Coordinates of suspected supernovae are forwarded 500 miles back down to Palomar to a 60-inch photometric tele-scope for detailed brightness measurements that same night—and possibly also to 15 other telescopes around the world for spectroscopic observation. Brilliant discovery The PTF's most spectacular find so far made newspaper headlines last summer: on August 24, 2011, a supernova (SN 2011fe) brightening in the Pinwheel Galaxy in Ursa Major only 21 million light-years away. The nearest and brightest Type Ia supernova to be spotted by the PTF, on September 10th, it peaked at visual magnitude 9.9. In a paper published in Nature on December 15th, 2011, Nugent and coauthors conclude that SN 2011fe was a white dwarf star 1.4 times as massive as the sun, but only the di-ameter of Earth. It was stealing gas from a close sun-like companion until a runaway thermonuclear explosion ig-nited. Found only 11 hours (plus 21 million years!) after it exploded, it was the youngest supernova ever detected. –Trudy E. Bell, M.A. Catching stars that go BANG! AstroShort The beautiful Pinwheel Galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major (the Big Dipper) is shown the night before supernova SN 2011fe exploded on August 22, 2011 (left), half a day after it exploded (middle) on August 23, and a day later (right) on August 24 (green arrows). The supernova reached maximum brightness on Septem-ber 10, 2011, and then began fading. It was both the nearest and the youngest supernova discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory, being discovered only 11 hours after it detonated. The Carver IBM iDataPlex supercomputer at NERSC at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory does much of the real-time analysis of images for the PTF, comparing digital images taken with the 48 -inch Samuel Oschin telescope on Mount Palomar with reference images to identify supernovae. It found SN 2011fe. The University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center (UC-HIPACC), based at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is a consortium of nine University of California cam-puses and three Department of Energy laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory). UC-HiPACC fosters collabora-tions among researchers at the various sites by offering travel and other grants, co-sponsoring conferences, and drawing attention to the world-class resources for computational astronomy within the University of California system.

Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Sep 08 First Quarter Moon Sep 01 Last Quarter Moon Aug 17 New Moon Aug 25 Are you curious about how to start taking pictures of the night sky with just a DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) camera? Craig will introduce both simple tripod photography and piggy-back photography that concentrates on 'prime focus' astrophotography --that is, using a DSLR camera on just a tripod or connecting a DSLR camera directly to a telescope so that the telescope becomes the camera lens. Why 'thirty seconds' in the title? Astrophotography is perceived as a very complicated and technically challenging endeavor, requiring a computer in the field and expensive equipment to perform successfully. However, with camera exposures up to thirty seconds a computer is not necessary to successfully take wonderful pictures of the night sky -- a tracking mount, telescope and DSLR camera are all that are required to get started in this great hobby. DSLR Astro-Imaging is the easiest way to get started in capturing portions of the night sky, and if you're traveling, the gear is lighter than you might think. You can image wide star fields of our galaxy the Milky Way, comets, constellations, planetary alignments, beautiful aurora, combined lunar and nature landscapes, polar star trails, and meteor showers. Great results can be achieved just with a tripod mounted camera and short exposures. Cameras that are mounted piggyback on telescopes or tracking platforms can capture images that rival images produced by professional observatories. Vast arrays of equatorial mounted DSLRs are being used for real research, and DSLR astrophotographers are discovering new variable stars, novas, supernovas, and exoplanets every day.

As he grew older, however, he became more interested in other pursuits -- some academic, some not quite so much -- and did not seriously return to his first love until after he got high school, university, his first job, marriage, and kids all squared away. In 2008 he received a telescope for Christmas from his better half (who had no idea what she was getting herself into), put a camera on it and was hooked. Since then he has found astrophotography to require a blend of artistic and technical discipline that deeply appeals to him. Originally from British Columbia Craig after moving around for years, he returned to the Pacific Northwest in 2009 and joined the Rose City Astronomers. He currently is the Sales Director and you can usually find him at the Sales Table during meetings. Professionally, Craig holds a Master's degree in Metallurgical Engineering from the University of British Columbia, and spent most of his career working in the steel industry. He now pays for his hobby as the quality assurance manager for a local steel mill. http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/tmw.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/astroimage.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/cosmology.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/youth/youthAA.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/youth.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/new_members.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sigs/downtowners.htm ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

If you are interested in volunteering for a single event or ongoing program, con-tact the RCA program director. If you have some time and skills but aren't sure where we need help, contact volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org and we'll find some-thing for you to do. To learn about public outreach events and volunteer needs, check out upcoming events on the RCA Forum. We have begun an "Introduction to Astronomy" series of educational and instructional tutorials focused on basic astronomy, equipment and observing skills, geared towards beginners wanting to learn the fundamentals of astronomical observing and imaging. Series will be every-other month (alternating with New Member Orientation) in the OMSI Planetarium 6:30 - 7:15 p.m. pre-ceding General Membership Meeting (third Monday of month). Instructors will be RCA member-volunteers. Format will be interactive presentation and lots of time devoted to Q & A. Future topics will be based on feedback from New Member Orientation meetings and keeping our ears open to what new members and other beginners are asking about. Please let David Nemo or Howard Knytych (email on page 3) of interest in any topic. http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/calendar/ http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/forum/simple/ http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sp/index.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sp/index.htm mailto:volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/forum/simple/index.php?board=40.0 http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/introastro.htm ver fifty stars and counting. That is the number visible within the Ea-gle Nebula, a riveting deep-sky ob-ject that occupies far eastern Serpens. It is actually composed of weaving patterns of tenuous matter that resemble an eagle's body with outstretched wings. Also known as the Star Queen Nebula, the colorful complex is home to the "Pillars of Creation," giant tow-ers of ultraviolet etched dust. In the second quarter of the 18th century, Swiss astronomer Philippe Loys de Chesé-aux was scanning the skies from his observa-tory in Lausanne when he chanced upon the brightest cluster stars. Unfortunately his discovery wasn't given international credit until 1884. Charles Messier noticed the same object in 1764, entering it as number sixteen on his famous deep-sky list. The nebulous portion, an area of ongoing star birth, is cata-loged separately today as IC 4703. A desig-nation of M16 (NGC 6611) addresses the easily recognizable open star cluster. The Star Queen is a signature member of four prominent bright nebulae that inhabit a narrow zone near the Galactic center. M17 (the Swan or NGC 6618) lies only 3° south, while the remaining Trifid and Lagoon asso-ciations grace the Milky Way deep inside the constellation Sagittarius. As a prime show-piece, the cosmic eagle spans 35' X 28' and illuminates the region with a strong 6th-magnitude glow. Serpens' best deep-sky object can be seen without any difficulty in ordinary 7 X 35 binoculars even under moderate light pollu-tion. Generally, most small instruments show just a loose assemblage of stars mingled with a faint fog-bound haze, which is pretty much what Messier saw centuries ago. To get a different perspective several re-cent era telescopes of varying aperture and design were put into active service. Besides the binoculars, a classic 1950's Lafayette 2.4-inch alt-azimuth "Planetoid" refractor was used for a basic look; upscale Meade 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain LX200 equipment and a 15-inch Dobsonian reflector produced far more dazzling reviews. The embedded star cluster is a trivial chal-lenge for our 2.4-inch scope. A blockbuster concentration of starlight decorates the northwestern half, where a wide 27" pair with 8th-magnitude components holds dominance. Sitting adjacent to the binary is a dented arc of five suns. In all, 20 members of M16 can be discerned in the little refractor. Narrowband filters of various kinds are now readily available to all levels of optical astronomy. Even in the Lafayette telescope significant differences appear if a nebula filter of the right type is selected. Options in-clude those that possess hydrogen-beta (Hβ), Oxygen-III, and UHC (ultra high contrast) light transmission capabilities. A factual demonstration of the Eagle's grandeur was given by the larger flagship equipment. Both professional models reveal an ornate kaleidoscopic field that's covered by a sensational number of luminous fea-tures. With an O-III filter, the nebula spreads conclusively northeast and southwest. The silhouetted fingers of M16's emission com-plex — knobby stalactites and stalagmites light years high — were recorded with equal frequency through each telescope. Astrono-mer Fred Hoyle once referred to these unlikely formations as "elephant trunks." However, the really best views come from the special art of astrophotography. Charac-teristics that make the Eagle Nebula so at-tractive — vivid color, young and nascent stars engulfed in a havoc of nebulosity, and mesmerizing glimpses of the Pillars of Crea-tion — are all in the exquisite image by Travis Rector and Brenda Wolpa, posted above on this page. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

Page 6 Peter Pan with a Telescope: Observing at Larch Mountain By Robert McGown On Sunday September 8 2013, I drove up to Larch Mountain for an evening star gazing with Michael Meo and his two sons Michael Kepler and John Domi-nic. It was a fall opportunity to sport a laser guided observing session on the 4,000 ft summit of Larch Mountain look-out. As the twilight faded to a starry dark-ness, we were pleased to observe an irid-ium flare and a few sporadic meteors. The Milky Way was spectacular, so we star hopped through the major constellations tour as I showed off the tea pot asterism. I had recently attended a play of Peter Pan that Michael Kepler had starred in which gave me the idea of Pete Pan with a Tele-scope theme. Peter Pan is a story mischie-vous boy that never grows up that was created by the Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie. Peter Pan was the leader of the Lost Boys, a gang of adventurous boys. In the play, they interacted with mermaids, fairies, pirates, and Indians. During this stellar evening, I shared a Greek myth about Orpheus and the Lyre and was re-galed with an abundance of greater detail from the boys. Here on Larch Mountain's summit, we used the abstract analogy of Peter Pan to describe the situation and the geography. The pillars of rock on the steep summit trail were silhouetted against the sky like the sails of Captain's Hook's pirate ship. We knew we were soon in for a ride on Carl Sagan's ship of the imagination in foreverland. For the whole evening, Michael Kepler regaled us with Greek myths and lore. Tonight on a journey of the imagination, we thought of what Einstein once said," Imagination is more important than knowl-edge." After we climbed down from the summit of the ancient volcano caldera, I joked that we might come across Captain Hook's crocodile on the narrow precipitous trail on Larch Mountain. We set up the 10 inch coulter telescope in the parking lot. Sometimes the Lost Boys are on Larch Mountain, visi-tors to the park, and they would share views in the telescope. You never know who you'll meet at Larch Mountain observing. We viewed through the Tetrad a few Messier objects and 457 (the ET clus-ter). Gazing at Andromeda M 31 and the satellite galaxies of Andromeda we thought of the incredible distances and never neverland. The Pin Wheel galaxy and M32 a dwarf elliptical and M110 an ill regu-lar galaxy were a visual delight near the great spiral of Andromeda. There are 9 galaxies that orbit An-dromeda that hoover around the parent galaxy. Michael and his sons were super excited to see the Milky Way in all of its glory with the constellations of the ecliptic. As we gazed at the Local Group galaxies, I knew that I knew that I wanted to never grow up peering through the telescope forever. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 7 Michael Sr. has a deep interest in the history of astronomy. This evening we didn't center on politics saving the planet as usual. Michael and I discussed romanticism in Russian astronomy in the early 19th century. The two of us have common interests in Russian astronomy, since I have been to Russian as-tronomy sites and Michael Meo translates Russian historic scientific documents. We have worked on a variety of Russian astronomy historical projects. As we came down the heavily wooded Larch Mountain road Michael and John sung Lord of the Rings songs as if we were really in a Tolkien forest with Frodo and Gandalf. John de Lacy, telescope maker, also shared his Tolkien experience with me and the Meo boys during their Tolkien audition. This eve-ning, it seemed so surreal that I actually felt as if I was in a time machine transported to New Zealand sharing the evening with Professor Tolkien. Some people have suggested that Tolkien's Lord of the Rings was allegorical for the World Wars, although Tolkien said there was no connection. Years ago at star parties in Canada with the AAVSO, one of Tolkien's colleague professors would show up at the star parties and entertain us with Tolkien anecdotes. Being a Tolkien admirer, I traveled to Free State, South Africa where Tolkien was born while I was working in Africa as an astronomer. On the way home, we also talked about the ancient constellation ship Argo and the sirens. I was driving through the construction area on the Terwillager curves on I-5; a huge flaming bolide came down seemingly over Tigard. It was strikingly green and breaking up with angular flames going out 30 de-grees straight out. I saw the flaming object for two and half seconds before it broke up in flames. I thought there might have been a shock wave. It looked as though the object had structure and was tum-bling. The bolide almost looked as if it could have been a helicopter crashing and breaking up. In the morning on the way to work, I called Richard Pugh, the meteoriicist with Cascadia Meteorite Labora-tory and reported the incredible bolide that I observed. It was an amazing finale at the end of a magical evening with the intellectual Meo family. The Larch Mountain Road would be snowed over soon and we left the imaginary world of the Lost Boys and Peter Pan back on the summit of Larch Mountain. The holiday season would be upon us. Very soon, I would put out my E=MC^2 Christmas lights on my observatory. I was recently amused that the Milky Way depicted in the bible was called the "firepath" and a meteorite depicted in the He-brew bible was called the "path of fire". It might have been how ancient scholar would use a metaphor and analogy to describe something seemingly supernatural. Over the holiday season, it was fun to en-tertain my friends in a Richard Feynman style of scientific imagination and the idea that Einstein was the second coming of Christ.  One of Albert Einstein's favorite biographies written by Abraham Pais was called Subtle is the Lord. I am not a deeply religious person, however sometimes it is fun to be creative with myth and literary allegory and explore our cosmic connectedness to the Universe. This evening, indeed we were like Peter Pan with a telescope on Larch Mountain's summit, sharing adven-tures in foreverland. References: 1. Barrie J.M.

The supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy will grab an appetizer in June—right in time for prime summer viewing for northern-hemisphere astronomers! From Earth, the center of the Milky Way is in Sagittarius near the border of Scorpius. The supermassive black hole, partly named for its host constellation, is called Sgr A* (pronounced "Sadge A-star"). From radio astronomy measurements, the Schwarzschild radius of Sgr A*—that is, of its "event horizon" beyond which light cannot escape—is known to be a quarter the radius of Mercury's orbit. But that entire volume is jam-packed with a mass 4 million times greater than our Sun. Starvation diet Weirdly, Sgr A* "is the most underluminous black hole observed," remarked Peter Anninos of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in northern California, meaning it hardly glows. True, the very definition of a black hole is something so massive that not even light can escape. But supermassive black holes in many other galaxies are sur-rounded by gas, dust, and other material. When material falls into, or accretes onto, a black hole, it emits a broad spectrum of radiation most intense in X-rays. SgrA* doesn't glow, though, because "it is starved for material," Anninos explains. Observations reveal that hun-dreds of hot young stars are whirling around SgrA* in orbits within 1 parsec (about 3 light-years). Measurements and calcula-tions sug-gest their stellar winds blowing away the gas are so fast and furious that "it is difficult to actually get the gas down to the black hole." Within this envi-ronment, however, "Sgr A* may occasionally enjoy a rela-tive feeding frenzy," continues Anninos and his three coau-thors from Livermore and the College of Charleston in South Carolina, writing in a November 2012 issue of The Astrophysical Journal. Maybe every 10,000 years or so a daredevil star zipping tauntingly close to SgrA*—about the Sun-Earth distance—might get torn apart by tidal forces and consumed. But that's a long time between meals. Cosmic cannibalism Enter the hapless gas cloud G2. In 2011, three astrono-mers detected a small clump of dusty, ionized gas near the galactic center; dubbed G2, it has a radius of 2 to 20 billion kilometers (about as big as our solar system) and a mass tri-ple Earth's. G2's dust is warm—550K, about twice Earth's temperature; its gas is 10,000K, twice as hot as our Sun. But G2 is far cooler than the heated, rarefied gas at the galactic center. Because cool clouds in such a hostile environment evaporate, G2 either formed shortly before it was detected or is part of a larger extended structure. Like a comet heading toward the Sun, G2 is plummeting toward Sgr A*. At closest approach (pericenter) in June, G2's center of mass will scream by only 4 billion kilometers away, scarcely more than 3,000 times the Schwarzschild ra-dius of Sgr A*. Although too dis-tant for G2 to be gulped whole (just as only rarely do sun-grazing comets actually plunge into the Sun), com-puter simulations reveal that enor-mous tidal forces will elongate G2 until it begins to fragment and lose angular momentum through interactions with background gas. "The cloud stretches into a stream of gas feeding the black hole," Anninos explains. The show will start in June and unfold through 2020. What might observers actually see? Astronomers are ex-cited to find out. Calculations suggest that while SgrA* won't turn the center of the Milky Way into an AGN (active galactic nucleus), it could brighten by more than 100 times the luminosity of our Sun, mainly in X-rays. With the right equipment, "this event should be easily observable over the next several years," Anninos estimates. "The break up of G2 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study accretion physics in the galactic center." –Trudy E.

Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Aug 10 First Quarter Moon Aug 03 Last Quarter Moon Jul 19 New Moon Jul 26 In June, Curiosity completed its first Mars year of fieldwork in Gale, a 96-mile-wide impact crater near the Martian equator. The rover team's main objective is to read the story of successive changes in past Martian environments recorded in the lower part of a 3-mile-high mountain of layered rock in central Gale known informally as Mt. Sharp. But the terrain on this mountain is too rugged for Curiosity's famous "7 Minutes of Terror" landing system, so the rover touched down, in August 2012, in the deep valley between the north wall of Gale and Mt. Sharp. The valley floor displays abundant outcroppings of rock formed from pebbles and sand that were transported by streams; it also found rock formed from mud. Mud that was at the bottom of a lake or pond. After drilling this mudstone, the team concluded that it was a record of a habitable environment — life as we know it might have been able to live in that water. Curiosity has arrived at the base of Mt. Sharp. From there, it will drive up hill and through time, each layer of rock younger than the one just below it; each layer telling us about a different Mars of long ago. Ken Edgett is the Principal Investigator for Curiosity's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) mounted on the turret at the end of the rover's robotic arm. MAHLI has acquired some of the most iconic images of the mission, including "selfies" of Curiosity at its sample extraction sites and close-ups of dust clinging to a 1909 Lincoln penny on the camera's calibration target. Ken is a Senior Research Scientist with Malin Space Science Systems of San Diego, California. The company built and operates Curiosity's four color cameras as well as cameras currently operating in orbit about the Moon and Mars and cruising toward Jupiter.

If you are interested in volunteering for a single event or ongoing pro-gram, contact the RCA program director. If you have some time and skills but aren't sure where we need help, contact volunteer@rosecityastronomers.org and we'll find something for you to do. To learn about public outreach events and volunteer needs, check out upcoming events on the RCA Forum. We have begun an "Introduction to Astronomy" series of educational and instructional tutorials focused on basic astronomy, equipment and observing skills, geared towards beginners wanting to learn the fundamentals of astronomical observing and imaging. Series will be every-other month (alternating with New Member Orientation) in the OMSI Planetarium 6:30 - 7:15 p.m. pre-ceding General Membership Meeting (third Monday of month). Instructors will be RCA member-volunteers. Format will be interactive presentation and lots of time devoted to Q & A. Future topics will be based on feedback from New Member Orientation meetings and keeping our ears open to what new members and other beginners are asking about. Please let David Nemo or Howard Knytych (email on page 3) of interest in any topic. ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Reserved. Page 5 Mount Sharp is anything but the normal central peak of an impact crater. Gale crater at 154 km (96 miles) in diameter is what is called a complex crater. Beyond a certain size, depending on the gravity of the planet, craters will have a central peak. It is similar to the spike of water which is thrusted upwards when you drop an object into a pool of water. Like the spike of wa-ter, an impact, thrusts regolith upwards and it collapses and coalesces into a central peak. However, with Mount Sharp there is something more. If the peak was nothing but a central impact peak, NASA with Mars Curiosity would not be trekking inside Gale Crater. Mars scientists believe that Gale crater after its creation was completely filled with sedimentary material from a series of huge floods passing over the surrounding terrain or by dust and ice deposits such as happened at the Martian polar caps. The deposi-tion over 2 billion years left a series sedimentary layers that filled the crater. Following the deposition of the layers, there was a long period of erosion which has finally led to the condition of the crater today. The erosion by some combination of aeolean (wind) forces and water (additional flooding), scooped out the huge crater, re-exposing most of the original depth. However, covering the original central peak are many sedimentary layers of debris. Gale crater's original central peak actually remains completely hidden and covered by sedimentation. This is what has attracted scien-tists with Curiosity to the base of Mount Sharp. Within the sedimentary layers covering Mount Sharp, there is a se-quential record of the events that laid down the layers. Embedded in each of those layers is a record of the environmental conditions on Mars going back over 2 billion years. At the base are the oldest sedimentary layers and as Curiosity climbs the flanks of the mountain, it will step forward in time. The advanced instrumentation residing on and inside Curiosity will be able to analyze each layer for material content and also determine its age. Each layer and its age will reveal information such as how much water was present, whether the water was alkaline or acidic, if there is any organic compounds. The discovery of organic compounds on Mount Sharp could be, well, Earth shaking. There are organic com-pounds and then there are organic compounds that are linked to life and this search for organics is of very high importance to this mission. Already, over the two year trek, Curiosity has seen numerous signs of the flow of water and sedimentation. At its first major waypoint, Glenelg, Curiosity stepped into an area called Yellow Knife Bay that showed numerous signs of past water. There were veins of magnesium salt deposits embedded in the soil, sedimentation and even conglomer-ate rock such as that found in river beds. There is another side to the terrain that Curiosity is traversing. The crater floor, essentially a flood plain has been particularly hard on the mobility system of Curiosity. Curiosity is now at the 6.6km point and the trek moves upward to see what the layers on Mount Sharp will reveal. Story and Photos from JPL Curiosity Finally Arrives at Mt.

Trout Lake Star Party photo above courtesy Michael Minnhaar Moon photos below courtesy David Haworth Full Moon Nov 06 First Quarter Moon Oct 30 Last Quarter Moon Oct 15 New Moon Oct 23 Mike Simmons has been involved in astronomy education and public outreach for more than 35 years. He has led and founded outreach organizations that share the work of astronomers and telescopic views of the sky with the public. He is a writer and photographer who has contributed to various publications, including Scientific American, Astronomy and Sky and Telescope, and he regularly gives presentations on astronomy. Recognizing astronomy as a universal interest that transcends cultural differences, Mike founded Astronomers Without Borders in 2006. He now serves as President of this effort to unite astronomy and space enthusiasts around the world through those common interests. Mike and Astronomers Without Borders held leadership roles in the International Year of Astronomy 2009, a UN-declared year that sought to bring astronomy to the public worldwide while conveying its importance to our common heritage and experiences. Minor Planet Simmons was named in his honor in 2003, in part for his "varied outreach activities in astronomy". Astronomers Without Borders is based on a simple truth – when we look up at the sky, no matter where we are, we know others are doing the same thing from other countries around the world. At similar latitudes the sky is identical regardless of where you are. And we all share the same wonder of the starry night sky, the planets and the entire Universe beyond. That wonder is part of the traditions of every culture, passed down through time. It will certainly be a part of our future as well. But there's more to it than the beauty of the Milky Way's thousands of stars seen from a dark location. When we look up we're looking outward, into our cosmic neighborhood. With a telescope we see even further into the cosmic hinterlands. For adventurers who long to see what lies on the other side of every hill, the Universe offers unlimited mysteries. The Universe – all that you see when you look up at the stars – is where we live. The Earth is one small part of it. If you've ever wanted to travel in space, just drive to a dark location, look up and take a look around. You're there, orbiting around our galaxy along with the rest of the inhabitants of Spaceship Earth.

The team of expert landscape astrophotographers assembled by project founder Babak Tafreshi has imaged the night sky from locations worldwide, showing a blanket of stars above historic, cultural and natural landmarks with stunning results. Whether it's a church, mosque, or synagogue in the earthly foreground, the sky above is the same. We can change details of the orb we live on but the rest of the Universe hovers beyond our reach, untouched, practically unchanging. This is the idea behind Astronomers Without Borders and the source of our slogan, One People, One Sky. The earthly view of the heavens is also strikingly similar to what some astronauts experience from their perch in orbit. Frank White coined the term, "The Overview Effect," in his book of the same name to describe the sensation astronauts often experience seeing the Earth hanging in space among the stars and other planets, without any apparent borders between us. I've told Frank I consider our view of the night sky to be the overview effect for the rest of us – those of us who will never travel out of Earth's atmosphere – and he agrees. When we connect with someone in a distant land, far beyond our horizon, and they're seeing the same sky we do (offset by time as the Earth rotates), the sensation of One People, One Sky is reinforced. The overview effect may not be as easy to visualize as from space – or as fun as being weightless – but it's there just the same. I started Astronomers Without Borders after visiting countries like Iran and Iraq, and meeting people who are far more like us than they are different. They have the same needs, wishes and problems as anyone else. I've given many presentations on astronomy in those countries to astronomy clubs in the US, and the focus inevitably turns to the difficulties others have in pursuing our common activities. Equipment we take for granted is difficult or impossible to acquire in many countries. Dark skies are out of reach without transportation. The result is sympathy for the situation of our colleagues and a desire to help. There's nothing political about it – it's nature, our common heritage. And it's there for everyone, an unlimited resource. Why shouldn't we all share in it equally? The political and other issues that seem so important most of the time just become irrelevant, at least for that moment. This is purely people to people interaction of the most basic sort. Astronomers Without Borders now has participants in most of the world's countries, with global programs that bring people together as never before. All based on our living on one planet, looking up at the same sky. An American amateur astronomer with the latest computerized gear and a student in a poor country may have different activities during the night but in the end they're there for the same reason. And they say remarkably similar things about the wonders of the night sky. After all, we're all looking out from the same place – Earth – and traveling together through the stars. http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/calendar/ http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/forum/simple/ http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sp/index.htm http://www.rosecityastronomers.org/sp/index.htm ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

The old logo was designed shortly after RCA was formed in 1988, and first appeared in the November 1989 edition of the RCA Gazette. No history of who designed it or what it represented could be found, so this article will serve that purpose for our new logo. The need to update the logo initially became an issue due to the non-digital format of the original artwork and thereby the un-suitability of the logo for use in imprinting or embroidering on a wider variety of clothing and other items. In addition, feed-back from new and younger members was that the logo appeared "old" and led them to presume the membership was also old and out-of-date. So, a secondary objective was to modernize the logo and give it a sharp, fresh, and younger look. Members James Martyn and Alejandro Appel (both professional graphic designers) answered my call for help in coming up with something new – with the Board ultimately settling on the design by Alejandro. Rather than go a completely different di-rection, we decided to maintain the basic elements of the original logo with some fresh and modern touches. While some thought the comet over Mt. Hood in the old logo was Hale-Bopp, it couldn't have been as Hale-Bopp didn't appear over Mt. Hood until 1997, nine years after the logo was created. But – we can say that now, as that was an iconic event that is worthy of being symbolized in our logo and certainly held the attention then, and in the memories still, of RCA members. Yes, the rose is gone – but in subtle homage to the rose, we've kept some thorny stems. The new text typeface is Insignia , with its own version of a thorn on some letters. And finally, we've added the notation of the club being established in 1988, to acknowledge that RCA is in fact growing 'old'. With the new logo of course comes NEW BRANDED CLOTHING – available for sale at our Sep-tember meeting.

Our own solar system has Saturn, while a multitude of geometrically similar objects inhabit deeper space. Starburst rings are something of an anomaly in the visual study of galaxies. These are dusty gas fed structures, where heated streams of material on a vast scale are being drawn into slim jackets or bands. Bril-liantly intense, star formation inside happens at an unusually vigorous pace. Comparative database searching indicates that Messier 94 (NGC 4736) falls into this classification. As an occupant of the constel-lation Canes Venatici, it follows the Big Dipper around the celestial pole, offering un-hampered access during a major portion of the year. A chart of the heavens places this 8th-magnitude object 3° northwest of Cor Caroli (α) in the mythological figure of Aste-rion and Chara. Pierre Méchain made the initial discovery of the galaxy on March 22nd, 1781. Several days later friend Charles Messier summed up his own observations: "Nebula without star above Charles' Heart. On the same parallel as the star beta. It is brilliant in the centre and the nebulosity is a little diffuse. It re-sembles the nebula which is below Lepus, No. 79, but is finer and brighter." At a dimension of 11.2' by 9.1', M94 has a noticeably oval disk characterized by a con-fection of tightly wound spiral arms, dusty mottling and a stunning saffron-tinted core. The distant hurricane-shaped galaxy is in a nearly face-on orientation with respect to the Milky Way, which helps to showcase its multiple rings and embedded arms. Many observers like Messier have been quick to point out how similar M94 is to an unresolved globular cluster. In a classic Ce-lestron 4.5-inch "Polaris" reflector it cer-tainly gives the first impression of a con-densed mass of stars, but after closer study vague traces of an overlying spiral pattern begin to emerge. Because of its rather small size and strong surface brightness, M94 ex-ults in high power views. Telescopes constrained by aperture fre-quently display a luminous disk devoid of any outward rings. For those who have ac-cess to 6-inch and larger pieces of equipment a much greater visual appreciation is possi-ble. Especially apparent is an intense central core that measures almost 30" across and an oval, collapsed annulus of surrounding mate-rial. Extending toward the periphery of the galaxy is a far dimmer halo of closely packed whorls, which dissolve into a number of irregular fragments as the telescopes' size is increased. At the very edge is another major feature of M94 — a great encircling ring that gradually fades into the dark back-ground of extragalactic space. This last so-called resonance structure has a measured diameter of approximately 15', making it the galaxy's largest contiguous ring zone. Hints of its existence may be de-tected in as little as a 4-inch telescope; at this aperture level skilled amateurs have de-scribed fleeting glimpses of a semi-detached circular band on the galaxy's outskirts, just beyond the brighter coiled disk. M94 is shown in a wonderful way through a 15-inch telescope. The object now offers an impressive canary-yellow center, pinpoint nucleus and a mesmerizing outer annex of thin spiral arms. However, the galaxy's fin-est feature still remains the inner 70" diame-ter halo of star formation, which appears as a tight matrix of patchy whorls. Exploration of the 16 million light-year distant island universe by remote satellite imaging produces some fascinating results. Data culled from NASA's highly successful GALEX instrument package shows the ob-ject's varied structural intricacies in great detail. In the active ultraviolet, M94's inner starburst-ring has an intense laser-like luster. This is a telltale sign of younger stars, which radiate photons profusely in that part of the spectrum. Alternative views from SPITZER reveal an infrared cascade of dusty spiral arms along with an enhanced central hub. The sky around Canes Venatici holds many common spirals but only one cham-pion example of a starburst-ring galaxy. When scanning the area for such deep-sky treasures as the famous Whirlpool (M51) and Sunflower (M63), don't forget to add M94 to your list of favorites. It has a galactic opulence that is worth the eyepiece journey. Starburst-Ring Galaxies Explore the beautiful whorls of a distant island universe through your telescope. By John W.

February 1987, the astronomical world was amazed by a powerful and wonderful phenomenon. A supernova appeared in the southern skies within one of our satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud. During that time it was a top topic among scientists and amateur astronomers. For night sky observers the kind of objects that leave evidence of such an energetic event, a cloud of stellar material known as a "supernova remnant", has fascinated human beings for centuries. As an observer, you are surely familiar with what may be the best example of them, the "Crab Nebula" (Messier 1) in the Milky Way galaxy, visible toward constellation Taurus (the bull). But, where can we find other examples of a "dead star´s relic" in the sky? The Large Magellanic Cloud could be a good site to look for them. I decided to carry out a short observing program containing four of this kind of object belonging to this nearby galaxy, which is high in the sky during the southern summer. I used the MCSNR (Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant Database) and the list given by C. Badenes, D. Maoz, and B. Draine in their paper "On the size distribution of supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds" (2010) to look for candidates to include in my list. The main criterion to select the sample to observe with a 16-inch dobsonian reflector was the brightness in optical wavelength. I have chosen supernova remnants that look seemingly brighter and more detached on DSS (Digitized Sky Survey) images and as isolated as possible from HII regions, thus avoiding a confusing identification of the target under observation. Certainly, DSS images are a very useful tool, in my opinion, to make this kind of analysis. Several supernova remnants, like N157B1 for example, or N159 (I talk briefly about this one in the article "A Remarkable Complex in the Vicinity of 30 Doradus", published in the May issue of the Rosette Gazette, Rose City Astronomers, 2012) lie in zones with prominent HII clouds so they are hard to identify. Both mentioned criteria drove me to compile the following short list, N49, N86, Detailed charts are necessary to find the supernova remnants and identify their main features and morphology. Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 7 DEM2 L 316A & B, and N63A. Now the nights at the observing field will told me how easy or hard each supernova remnant is to see. I spent two nights (January 3 and 4) to observe the first two supernova remnants (i.e. N49 and N63A). The observations were made when the galaxy was at its highest in the sky, around its transit through the local meridian. The N49 Supernova Remnant Embedded in the North Blue Arm3, this is a bright X-ray and optical supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (Long et al. 1981); certainly, it is the optically brightest object of this kind in this galaxy. D.S. Mathewson and J. R. Healy identified this remnant while Park et al. (2003) state that its age is about 6,000 years. Moreover, it is almost surely the result of a type II explosion. You can see here a short video about this supernova remnant by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Before observing this object I was reading papers and watching pictures about this magellanic remnant. It shows a peculiar shape suggesting me the nickname of "South America Nebula" (because of the mirror image of this part of the continent). I went to a place named "Potrerillos" to set up a 16-inch telescope and observe N49. The night was clear and dark so I had good conditions to study this object. I made a first observation of the field where N49 lie using low magnification (43x). This eyepiece gave me a 1.2 degree field of view where the most conspicuous object is the globular cluster NGC 1978, which is clearly detected through a 16-inch. The other region dominating the zone is the 10 Myr old OB association4 LH535 that lies about 10 arc minutes to the south-southwest of the remnant and is associated with it. It is also known with the entry 1948 in the more familiar catalogue NGC. It was discovered in 1826 by James Dunlop from Australia. This 11.6 magnitude association appears like a roundish hazy patch containing several faint stars of similar brightness that are better viewed using averted vision. Figure 1. Picture of the Large Magellanic Cloud showing the positions of the four supernova remnants. North is up. Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 Some of very faint nebulosity seems to be in the zone connecting LH53 and NGC 1978. At this magnification N49, with an angular size of 1.4 arc minute, is very difficult to see. If you look carefully using averted vision and with patience an extremely faint, smooth, round, and small nebulosity can be glimpsed. Higher power is necessary to see this remnant better. Take a look at Figure 2.1. There you will see a small nebulosity and a star very close to each other (indicated with β). This object was visible like a faint "defocused" star. In fact, it was visible more clearly than N49 at this power. It is time now to see N49 using a little higher magnification. A 32mm eyepiece gave me 56x. Now N49 is more clearly visible, even with direct vision a small and rather round nebulosity is visible. However, averted vision improves the view, N49 appears then more contrasted against the background sky. The UHC filter improves a lot the view of the remnant which is clearly seen with direct vision. Using averted vision two or three brighter spots are visible within the object, higher magnification is necessary to try to see them better and with more detail. One of these spots looks a little brighter, being situated in the area indicated with number 1 in Figure 2.1. Using an OIII filter the view also improves. The bright spots are visible for moments. The view is not as sharp as that obtained with the UHC filter. The background sky did not look too dark through the Orion Ultrablock filter. Very faint background nebulosity makes the view of N49 not so sharp. However, the view is better than that without a filter, with N49 being clearly identified in the field. H-Beta was not useful to see this remnant. The view at 106x starts to reveal some of the internal structure of the remnant. The view of N49 and LH53 is very interesting. The association is a conspicuous object in the field and now several of its stars can be seen. At this magnification N49 starts to show its peculiar shape, somewhat triangular. A small dark region seems to lie in the southwest part (blue arrow in Figure 2.1). Without a doubt the region 1 appears a little brighter. The "South America" and North America nebulae (left and right respectively). Two objects displaying "continental" shapes but with a very different origin. While the North America is a star forming region, the South America nebula is a vestige of a star that exploded in our neighbor galaxy thousands of years ago. Images are not at scale. N49 is in the reach of an 8-inch telescope. This sketch, made by the author, gives a clue of what to expect to see through this kind of instrument at 119x and dark sky conditions. Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 The UHC filter at this magnification helps to identify both the spots and the faint regions (see Figure 2.1). These regions show a smooth brightness. I also used OIII and Orion Ultrablock at 106x. The first one helps to see the remnant. On the other hand, Ultrablock filter shows a brighter image and in this case the fainter regions of the remnant are a little better viewed. H-Beta filter was absolutely useless. Without any filter the small nebulosity and faint star are clearly visible (β in Figure 2.1). I made a final observation of N49 using 200x. I think we are around the best magnification to see this supernova remnant. N49 looks just beautiful. Even if we are talking about a faint nebulosity this magnification makes possible to see and suggest the shape of South America including the dark lane or zone in the west part of this object. At this magnification the faint star (A) is visible. It is a good guide or "candle" to try to catch the narrow region of the remnant immediately to the left of this star on the image here. However, the "southern tip of South America" (north end of the remnant) was not possible to identify with certainty. I only used the UHC filter at this power and the view, as in the other cases, was improved. Zone 1 can be viewed appearing somewhat brighter and noticeable. The other fainter parts of the remnant were visible too but even with this filter the north end was not very well viewed. Filter Notes UHC (Ultra High Contrast) Lumicon Excellent. Very good contrast. Bright spots can be seen within the remnant OIII Very good. Bright spots visible for moments Orion Ultrablock Good. Less contrast than OIII H-Beta Useless. The remnant is not visible at all Figure 2. DSS image of N49 (center) and its surrounding field. Figure 2.1 N49 supernova remnant Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 The N86 Supernova Remnant SSituated at the west end of the stellar bar we find this object. A good way to find the area is to use the stars µ Mensae and θ Doradus that are visible with the unaided eye from dark sky sites. The position of the target is equidistant from these stars (see Figure 1 on page 7). Overall, the optical morphology of N86, which has an angular size of 3.5 arc minutes, shows a relatively well defined shell rich in internal filamentary structure, and a large jet-like feature extending to the north. It can be described (in optical morphology) in terms of four "quadrants", the eastern quadrant is the brightest of the three (paper "Supernova Remnants in the Magellanic Clouds. II. Supernova Remnant Breakouts from N11L and N86" R. M. Williams, Y. Chu, and J. R. Dickel, 1999). On a colorful note, we can say that N86 is also known by the nickname "Lionel Murphy Nebula" after Lionel Murphy who was a justice of the High Court in Australia. That nickname comes from Dopita, Mathewson and Ford, who studied the remnant and found that its shape resembles Murphy´s large nose. I observed this object under very good seeing conditions. A first view of the field around N86 at 43x shows stars with rather similar brightness, without very bright stars. The most conspicuous object there is the cluster with nebulosity NGC 1770, discovered in 1826 by James Dunlop. Look at Figure 3, the stars forming a triangle were very useful to reach the accurate zone of N86 (which is at the center of the field in the image) with its vertex pointing to that area. The star GSC-9161-08046 in the picture was also visible at this power helping to scan the area looking for some nebulosity of this remnant. Using some higher magnification (56x) a very faint nebulosity can be barely glimpsed using averted vision. The small nebulosity is coincident with the brighter region indicated by the DSS image of this remnant (see Figure 3-1). This brighter area lies in the eastern tip of N86, in the "eastern quadrant" mentioned above. A UHC filter brings the remnant to the view but still very faint and hard to see. A smooth nebulosity lies close to GSC-9161-0804. Averted vision and a very slight movement of the telescope were necessary to improve the challenging view. This filter seems to work a little better than an OIII, which makes possible to see this part of the remnant for a moment. On the other hand, an H-Beta filter is useless. Higher magnification is necessary for a better analysis of this supernova remnant. Figure 3. The N86 supernova remnant is the faint nebulosity immediately to the south of the star GSC-9161-0804. Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 I observed this remnant again on a different night using 106x. I must say that the galaxy was low in the sky at the moment of this observation (29 degrees) so the results of seeing N86 under this condition must be not the best. At this power some of extremely faint and subtle nebulosity seems to lie in the zone of the stars indicated with A in Figure 3.1. Using a UHC filter I was able to glimpse the nebulosity a little better close to the star GSC-9161-0804 (indicated with the arrow in Figure 3.1) and embedding the stars mentioned above. This area is the brightest portion of the remnant as appears in the DSS image. The view through the Orion Ultrablock filter was not as good as UHC but it was possible to glimpse some nebulosity embedding the stars A. I also observed this part of the remnant with an OIII filter. The faint nebulosity was visible using averted vision with a sharper view for a very brief moment. Even higher magnification (200x) makes it possible to see the field of the remnant with more details with the three stars (A) and the pair (B) identified. Averted vision is necessary to see them. I think the view at 200x was not better than that at lower power (106x). At 200x none of nebulosity is visible in the field. Using the UHC and Orion Ultrablock filters the faint nebulosity between the star GSC and the stars A was barely visible for moments. The N63A Supernova Remnant I should call it "the high-magnification-remnant". It is embedded in a larger H II region, N63, and appears to be located within the OB association NGC 2030 (LH83) (Chu & Kennicutt 1988). The SNR is expanding within a bubble produced by its progenitor within the N63 H II complex. N63A is believed to be the product of the explosion of a massive star in a dense and complex environment (Shull 1983; Hughes, Hayashi, & Koyama 1998) and is the first Figure 4. The small supernova remnant N63A. Even if the DSS image shows a "bright" and concentrated spot within a cluster with nebulosity, the view through a 16-inch is quite different, being a faint and elusive spot to catch. North is down, east to the right. Figure 3.1. DSS image of the N86 supernova remnant Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 confirmed SNR in an HII region (Shull 1983), see "Revealing New Physical Structures in the Supernova Remnant N63A Through Chandra Imaging Spectroscopy", Jessica S. Warren and John P. Hughes (2003). Let´s start by saying that this is a very challenging object even for a 16-inch telescope. Although it is in an HII region (it doesn`t match one of my selection criteria) I thought this would be an easier object to visually observe taking into account the "brightness" of the remnant (shown in Figure 4 above). If you compare it with the brightness of N49 on DSS images, you should think that it would be relatively easy to see...but that was not the case. I observed this object during a night of very good seeing on January the 4th 2014. The observing site, Potrerillos, offers good dark skies to see deep sky objects. My friend Carlos Gutierrez, who was observing Jupiter that night, stated that the view of the planet was really astounding. I think we had an excellent seeing, and the transparency was good enough. I observed this remnant the night after the N49 observation. At 43x I scanned the surrounding field where N63A lies. The field shows some rather faint stars. Some of the brighter stars form a pattern I could easily identify to be sure I am in the accurate zone of this remnant. As I said before, this remnant is situated in the association NGC 2030. Wolfgang Steinicke's Revised NGC and IC Catalog shows this object like a diffuse nebula or a supernova remnant while the NGC/IC Project web page states that NGC 2030 is a cluster with nebulosity. It was discovered by John F. W. Herschel in 1826, He recorded it as "bright, large, gradually brighter in the middle". It looks like a round nebulosity embedding several faint stars of similar brightness that are better detected using averted vision. One of the stars looks a little brighter. Unlike N49, which is visible even at low magnification, N63A is not detected at 56x. Several stars embedded in the nebulosity of NGC 2030 are obviously better detected at this power and the brighter star is visible again when you see the stellar swarm using averted vision. At 56x using a UHC filter the nebulosity of the association is better seen, appearing more detached and round in shape. Other nebulae areas jump into view in the field using this filter. I got a similar image using an OIII filter. With an H-Beta filter I could see a smooth and faint nebulosity. However, this filter did not help very much to try to identify the supernova remnant within the complex. 106x, at this magnification the detailed structure of the association is visible making it possible to identify the accurate position of the supernova remnant. The stars indicated with blue circles in Figure 4 were identified and a faint nebulosity was visible engulfing those stars and the nearby area. Using the UHC filter, that nebulosity looks more detached. In the zone where N63A lies I could barely glimpse, using averted vision, a very small slightly brighter spot (the remnant???). The view was very hard so higher magnification was necessary to try to get a better view. I decided then to ignore the other filters and apply higher power to the telescope. Using 288x without any filter I could see the remnant! But it is still a very challenging and elusive object. Averted vision is necessary to see it, suggesting for moments a sort of roughly triangular shape, very small. Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 The view at this magnification with UHC was a little worse. N63A is situated in a nebulae area so the view was always difficult. The Obscure DEM L 316 Supernova Remnant I observed this faint object from Uspallata valley on February 1st, starting at 10:30pm local time (UT – 3hs) with the Magellanic Cloud at its highest point (53 degrees). The seeing was not perfect that night though to try to see which I guess is the faintest remnant of the list. This peanut-shaped nebula was first noted by Mathewson & Clarke (1973) to have a high [S ii]/H_ ratio, a typical signature of supernova remnants (SNRs). The authors designated the two lobes of this system shells A (the northeastern shell) and B (to the southwest) (paper "Supernova Remnants in the Large Magellanic Clouds VI. The DEM L316 Supernova Remnants" R. M. Williams and Y.-H. Chu (The Astrophysical Journal, 635:1077–1086, 2005 December 20)). These two shells are: A) two independent remnants superimposed along the line of sight (Mathewson & Clarke, 1973), B) a single supernova that exploded into an interconnected bubble formed by a stellar wind or a previous supernova (Lasker 1981; Mills et. Al. 1984), or C) "colliding remnants" (Williams et. al. 1997) (paper "ASCA Observations of the Twin Supernova Remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud, DEM L316" by M. Nishiuchi, J. Yokogawa and K. Koyama, 2000). At 43x the field of view shows the brightest stars grouped in the eastern region, being visual magnitude 7.6 HD 40156 the brightest one. The stellar patterns (stars linked with blue lines) in Figure 5 were easily recognized thus confirming that it is the accurate area of the remnant. The most conspicuous object in the field is a bright and slightly northeast-southwest elongated nebulosity, NGC 2122. If you pay attention to the opposite zone (180 degrees from the stellar pattern, right on Figure 5) a very faint and extended nebulosity can be glimpsed. Just a small movement of the telescope toward the west makes possible to see more nebulosity with several faint stars and some small hazy spots embedded there, all of this a result of our proximity to the amazing complex 30 Doradus which lies at only one degree to the northwest of DEM L 316. At this magnification the target was not visible at all, only the stars labeled A, B, and C in Figure 5.1 were identified (C appearing a little dimmer). Higher magnification is necessary to try to glimpse this object. Figure 5. DEM L 316 (center) and the surrounding field. Extragalactic Supernova Remnants September 2014 ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 At 56x, the stars 1 in Figure 5.1 can be glimpsed for a moment, appearing very faint. Even if the remnant is not visible at this power, the identification of the stars A, C and 1, whose positions delineate (in some sense) the remnant, makes possible to concentrate the view on this small area. At this time of the observation I guessed that to try to see DEM L 316 would be a "retinal torture". Using an UHC filter, I could see for a brief moment and in a very hard way (using averted vision of course) a very dim and small nebulosity which position I have indicated with the blue ellipse in Figure 5.1. I can certainly not affirm I saw part of DEM L 316 because the nebulosity was in the very threshold of visibility (bigger scopes are welcome!). I get a similar view using an OIII filter. The ghostly nebula seems to be the south-east edge of the bigger lobule (DEM L 316 B). Like with the other remnants, the H-beta filter did not help to see this object. At 106x the view starts to be more interesting. The pair of stars 1 is viewed much more clearly showing both stars a similar brightness. Once again, the extremely faint hazy area within the ellipse is visible with difficulty. I only used an UHC filter with this eyepiece but the view did not show an evident nebulosity. Even at high magnification (200x) this remnant or parts of it are not easy to catch. DEM L 316 is a target for astrophotographers or owners of bigger aperture telescopes, always remembering that good conditions for transparency and seeing are a must for a successful observation. CONCLUSIONS This kind of obscure object can be a good target for those observers who want to test their capability of using averted vision and extreme visual conditions. Most of these supernova remnants were virtually invisible, at least in my observing conditions that consisted of a 16-inch "well-collimated" mirror, "my own eyes", "clean" optics, a site offering usually a value of 6.2 as a mean limiting magnitude sky (which is not the best limiting magnitude at all!), etc. Surely, other observers using bigger mirrors or the same aperture but under a darker sky would be able to see these objects a little better, at least in some cases. The cases of DEM L 316 and DEM L 299 (I observed this last remnant but I have not included a report in this article) are good examples of a situation where you must use averted vision and observe the zone for several minutes. Then take a couple of minutes of rest and observe it again. I´m sure that is a situation where you are undoubtedly in the "threshold of the imagination". Are you really seeing something like a tiny and very dim filament or is your brain trying to trick you? Without a doubt N49 is, by far, the brightest and easier remnant to see. You will be able to see it even in smaller telescopes, like 8-inch for example, being obvious even without filters in bigger instruments. Well, if you see at least N49 you can be sure that you were able to add an extragalactic supernova remnant to your observing log files. Figure 5.1.

"L" refers to the Lamont-Hussey Observatory of the University of Michigan; "Ha" means the Hydrogen-alpha emission line, the key signature line used in the survey; "120" refers to the plate number (objective prism plate) for the LMC; "N" labels the object as a nebula, as distinct from a star (label "S"). Some of the more complex nebulae are subdivided, using the letters A,B,C etc to indicate related knots of nebulosity within the complex. 2_ DEM is a catalogue of 357 nebulae in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 167 nebulae in the Small Magellanic Cloud that was published in 1976 by R.D. Davies, K.H. Elliot and J. Meaburn. The LMC catalogue is DEM L and the SMC catalogue is DEM S. 3_ This is the name of one of the structures extending off the ends of the LMC bar that are morphologically similar to spiral arms. The blue arm is still remarkable as the remains of a major star formation event in the outer disk of the LMC 100–160 Myr ago. 4_ OB Association: The concept of a stellar association was originally introduced in 1949 by V. A. Ambartsumian, who later separated them into OB and T associations (Ambartsumian 1968). Morgan, Sharpless, & Osterbrock (1952) considered as a stellar association any loose group of stars within an area where bright OB stars exist and with evidence of a common origin. A recent definition of a stellar association (Kontizas et al. 1999) refers to it as a single, unbound concentration of early-type luminous stars, embedded in a very young star forming region. 5_ LH is a catalogue of OB associations in the Large Magellanic Cloud published by Lucke & Hodge (1970). 6_ GSC stands for Guide Star Catalogs, created by the staff of the Catalogs and Surveys Branch of the Space Telescope Science Institute.

Their mission is to be a focal point for light pollution issues in the NW, promote quality outdoor lighting, promote and preserve the night sky and educate the public about the problems of light pollution and its solutions. Light pollution is any adverse effect of artificial light, including sky glow, glare, light trespass, light clutter, decreased visibility at night, and energy waste. Light pollution wastes energy, disrupts global wildlife and ecological balance, and has been linked to negative consequences in human health. Mission of the IDA: The mission of the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is to preserve and protect the nighttime environment and our heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting. Goals: 1. Stop the adverse effects of light pollution, including; Energy waste, air and water pollution caused by energy waste Harm to human health Harm to nocturnal wildlife and ecosystems Reduced safety and security Reduced visibility at night Poor nighttime ambience 2. Raise awareness about light pollution, its adverse effects, and solutions 3. Educate about the values of quality outdoor lighting.

The Illinois-based indus-try giant Sears, Roebuck & Co. has a rich history of commercial sales, with a broad-ranging display of celestial-themed memora-bilia. Especially fundamental to many collec-tors are their cost-effective 2.4- and 3-inch models, which were sold in great abundance during the last 20th century. For three years, starting in 1970, a new 3.5-inch F/16 "Discoverer" became an infre-quent but highly touted visitor to their legen-dary catalog pages. To date, only an esti-mated 400 complete instruments are known to have been pledged for customer review and purchase. Somewhat unorthodox in de-sign but above standard in performance, this comparatively rare Sears product has achieved a very high ranking among devoted classic telescope fans. An initial advertisement appeared in the Fall and Winter "big book" of 1970, where it was offered at a reasonable price of $499.95. In the company's numbering system a se-quence of #6345 confirms the 3.5-inch (met-ric 90mm) refractor's identity. Exceeding the aperture boundary of its smaller trusted sales companions by a slight margin, this luxury model possesses the light gathering ability of 165 human eyes. The long-focus refractor was crafted ex-clusively in Japan by master opticians. Through international marketing agreements, Astro Optical Industries Co., Ltd. was as-signed the task of supplying the prestigious telescope. Since 1957, this particular over-seas manufacturer was the primary source for equipment acquisitions by both Tasco (think of their "Solarama" line) and Sears. Judging by the positive response, Astro's precision merchandise had a major influence on optical sales throughout the world. To many wishful astronomers, this special Discoverer offered a magical entry into the field of refractor ownership. Ever since Sears directed its distribution, the interest among skygazers has been overwhelming. It was also a viable alternative to comparable Uni-tron equipment, which for decades had been setting a standard of excellence in the tele-scope industry. The thrill of owning and operating another superbly performing instrument from Sears had just settled in when production ceased suddenly in 1972. A dramatic price drop to $299.95 was the strategy used to closeout the remaining inventory. (In 1971 it supposedly had a cost of $399.95.) As a result of the telescope's limited availability and other factors, contemporary worth often exceeds $1,000 or more at sanctioned auction sales. The author's equipment diary boasts a total of six separate #6345 purchases. In fact, EQUIPMENT DIGEST Classic Telescopes in Astronomy An obscure Sears 3.5-inch refractor from the early 1970s entices collectors. By John W. Siple ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Very limited numbers of the #6345 telescope were made available by Sears. Two catalog promotions from the early 1970s are displayed directly below, courtesy of Sears Archives. Page 5 they were discovered under a wide range of serendipitous and sometimes entertaining circumstances. In the quest for secondhand equipment, local and regional purchases provided the best values, where firsthand inspection and direct negotiation was possi-ble. Conducting long distance transactions, such as from eBay and Craigslist, were forthright but never resulted in true bargains. It was a classified advertisement in the Oregonian newspaper which ultimately be-came the incentive for future searches. The desirable telescope was located in the base-ment of a house in Milwaukee, a large Port-land suburb, and belonged to an avid model railroader. His reason for selling the Sears refractor was simple: he needed the money to fund more train projects. (The floor of his basement was one big hobby layout with tons of track, tunnels, and stations.) The telescope itself was in fair shape but unfortunately missing the original wooden tripod and 40mm auxiliary viewfinder. To compensate, he quickly pointed out its many remaining positive features and fair asking price. As a last courtesy, the seller ran one of his prized locomotives, its whistle signaling the transfer of this rare Sears treasure (serial number 990381) to a satisfied new owner. Several years later, word of my interest in astronomy appeared in a workplace publica-tion about employee activities. One reader of Only about 400 of these rare Sears telescopes are known to exist. Always in demand, they are considered a leading item in most collections. this February '92 interagency bulletin was a Spokane field geologist and amateur star-gazer who had several oddball pieces of equipment for sale. We eventually met east of Portland on a rainy Columbia Gorge day, the back of his vehicle holding an 8-inch F/8 Cave Astrola reflector telescope. (The genu-ine Alika K. Herring primary mirror, circa 1961, later became an article topic for Sky & Telescope magazine.) A once neglected Sears #6345 mounting head was also cheerfully acquired during our brief visit. Beautifully preserved, it had all of the features common to that product — counterweights, control cables, and a work-ing tracking motor. Inasmuch as it was a real pleasure to find, a frustrating mystery still surrounds the unexplained loss of the valu-able (and irreplaceable) tube assembly. The Table Mountain Star Party near El-lensburg, Washington attracts vendors and hundreds of other participants from through-out the region. In 1997, while attending the event it was noticed that a Seattle area ex-hibitor had brought an interesting truckload of miscellany. Buried among the items was the welcomed presence of a Sears #990383 refractor, which soon found a place in my Toyota sedan. Unfortunately the integral star tracking motor was missing, a somewhat annoying but tolerable problem. (Optically it proved to be a real gem and absolute paragon of mechanical movements, providing many memorable views of the stars and planets.) Fast forward ten years to an era now dominated by rapid internet communication and frequent online dealing. This switch in venue produced two more nicely crafted 90mm telescopes from Sears.

The tracking motor for right ascension is the boxlike device shown in Figure 7. mercial turf made personal inspection almost impossible; tidbits of information about each telescope were trusted to the seller despite some reserved skepticism. San Diego, California sets the stage for a successful Craigslist purchase. Here, pic-tured in the fenced backyard of a rural Spring Valley residence, sat a battered but fully functional stargazing tool. Definitely not in showroom condition, it displayed a legacy of cosmetic issues that included a scratched white metal tube and water dam-aged objective lens. The serial number was #990112, identify-ing it as the 112th model in a closed se-quence of approximately 400 instruments. Despite its pitfalls the 1970's imported Sears refractor still gives a convincing perform-ance, regularly showing fine detail in distant galaxies and on the lunar surface. Another glimpse through the public inter-net resulted in the procurement of #990152. Found by a thrifty individual at an estate sale in neighboring Ventura, it was eventually posted through an astronomy forums' web-site. In much better condition than #990112, this Sears work was without a tracking de-vice, one item apparently overlooked during the impromptu rummage hunt. From emails, it was discovered that the telescope once belonged to a family patriarch who had recently passed away. Before the sale relatives used it to briefly view a comet, but since no one expressed interest in saving the telescope it later became part of the es-tate belongings. An unlikely but fortuitous set of circumstances sent this rare classic to a new home across the Oregon border and into the hands of an enthusiastic collector. Sears' knack for commer-cial expansion is exemplified by the Midtown Exchange, a major retail store and re-gional hub that once em-ployed nearly two thousand workers. Built in 1928, it is conveniently located on Lake Street in Minneapolis, Min-nesota. (Eight years ago the famous landmark was rede-veloped into the Midtown Global Market, a local net-work of affordable shops and community services.) A flashback to the early '70s finds a Lake Street store manager considering the closeout sale on a large Dis-coverer telescope, which was later purchased as a gift for his father in-law. An unsolicited telephone inquiry earlier this year from the retired manager's wife led to my ownership of this fine #990354. As-sembled only once in Minneapolis, it had gathered dust and cobwebs from storage in their attic. A wonderful piece of nostalgia, it turned out to be in superb shape with an untouched objective lens. (The 1400mm focal length refractor is pictured in its card-board crate on the previous page.) However, nothing lasts forever in a collec-tion. Our writer's #990381 (optical tube only) made its way to an astronomy enthusi-ast in Vancouver after much negotiation, the Sears #990112 of Craigslist fame is used nightly, #990383 went in a roundabout way to a Chicago area collector and the single mounting platform of Spokane heritage is carefully stored away, its occasional purpose to hold various types of quality, older Japa-nese and American-made optical gear. Although deemed a good optic, #990152 was nevertheless auctioned off at a loss to a fellow member of the astronomer's guild. With its documented provenance and un-usual condition #990354 remains the center of attraction at home. Literature and related paper memorabilia grace bookcase shelves, finding use on cloudy nights. Before an extended tryout, certain changes to existing pieces of equipment are highly recommended. Replacement of the both the weak tripod system and trunnion sleeve may become necessary. Some people purchase a tall metal pier for added stability, while the thin wrap-around cradle rings (which can cause scratching) are often upgraded with thicker diameter versions from such compa-nies as Parallax Instruments. An advertisement in the Starry Messen-ger, a long out-of-print classified shopper, produced a wonderful pedestal substitute from Pentax. Homemade stands also work great. The top portion of an orange cast iron pillar stand is shown holding #990152. It was fabricated years ago by a Portland area resident (he took first place in his Benson High School welding class for the project). The Sears #6345 odyssey continues with the hunt for more lucrative equipment. Be-cause of a limited abundance, it's not an easy task for today's generalist collector. Organ-ized searches have shown a dearth of avail-able low cost models. Online auctions relin-quish an occasional instrument, calculated at the rate of one or two per year, but the ma-jority of 90mm telescopes remain hidden in dark attics and basements. To everyone's best knowledge nothing below #990100 has yet appeared. In some corner of the world a coveted #990001 must exist, its value exceeding that of any cur-rently known Sears Discoverer. Maybe a future collector will stumble upon this iconic treasure and finally settle the debate about those missing low numbered telescopes. Literature from Sears included this pamphlet, which lists many of the accessories found on the 3.5-inch F/16 telescope (above, circa 1964).

Page 8 The M31 Twist and Fast Scopes I recently completed an 8 inch f 3.3 Dobsonian and enjoyed observing with it at the Oregon Star Party this past August for the first time under dark skies. As you might imagine, a scope this size and short focal length excels at very wide field observing, and my most memorable and unexpected observation was of M31's twist. Never heard of M31's twist? Neither had I until I plainly saw it in the 8 inch at 37x with my first glance in the eyepiece. M31 and its two main satellite galaxies, M32 and M110, were nicely framed in the eyepiece with M31 nearly spanning the entire width of the fov. I expected to see the tilted disk of M31 highlighted with a few star clouds, but what I saw was the disk with what appeared to be a distinctive tuft trailing off each end like water out a gently rotating sprinkler. Was I ever surprised! By the way, the near side (facing M110) seemed quite straight and was highlighted by two dust lanes. The far side (facing M32) looked slightly curved This is my sketch of M31's twist from the 2014 OSP using the 8 inch f3.3 scope. The lack of stars is an indication of the quick nature of the sketch. M31 is a disturbed spiral, and is organized more in concentric rings than distinct arms, so what I saw is likely the brighter parts of the star forming regions that are most densely grouped toward the outer regions of M31's disk. From our perspective in the Milky Way, this appears to give M31 its twist. You can see these blue-ish star clouds in the photo below, most noticeably to the lower left, and get a hint of the twist if you squint just right. But photos don't show what the eye perceives, so to really see the twist you'll have to see it through a short focus scope.

Page 9 http://www.phy.davidson.edu/FacHome/mjb/astrophotography/mario2011/jpg/m31_618mm_LRGB_19by600_26by300sV2.jpg While I was describing my observation of M31 to several people at the OSP, including Mel Bartels, he said, "Oh, you saw M31's twist!" Mel had seen the twist previously in his wonderful 6 inch f2.8 and 10 inch f2.7 scopes, and before the star party was over I had a look at M31 through both these scopes. The twist was most pronounced in his 6 inch because it had the wider fov and put M31 in the best context with its surroundings – a marvelous view. In general, small, fast scopes provide new perspectives on familiar objects because of their ability to pro-vide a larger context with significant light gathering ability. For now, they're not widely available because the fast primary mirrors take considerably more time and skill for opticians to make to the same quality as a common f5 optic. Steve Swayze is the only optician I know of that will make small mirrors like this professionally, and we're fortunate that he's in Portland. Of course, you can make one yourself but be prepared for a challenge because the sweet spot for a well corrected parabola in the f3 range is really, really small. To get an idea of what can be seen beyond M31's twist in small, fast scopes, see some of Mel's sketches using his 6 inch f2.8, along with a discussion about building and using this scope at: http://www.bbastrodesigns.com/6inchF2.8/6%20Inch%20F2.8%20Telescope.html ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 "20 Things You Didn't Know About Galaxies" by Katherine Kornei -- also appearing in this month's DiscoverMagazine.com." 1. Eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant was one of the first people to theorize that the Milky Way was not the only galaxy in the universe. Kant coined the term island universe to describe a galaxy. 2. Astronomers now estimate that there are 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. 3. One of the earliest uses of the English term Milky Way was in Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century poem "The House of Fame." He likened the galaxy to a celestial roadway. 4. While we're talking road trips: Due to the expansion of the universe, most other galaxies are receding from our own. Galaxies farther from the Milky Way are speeding away faster than those nearby. 5. Some of the galaxies receding from the Milky Way are ellipsoidal, like footballs. Galaxies can also be thin and flat with tenta-cle-like arms — just like the Milky Way. 6. Galaxies come in irregular shapes, too, including many dwarf galaxies. These galaxies, the smallest in the universe, contain only a few hundred or a few thousand stars (compared with 100 billion stars in the Milky Way). 7. You'll often find dwarf galaxies clustered around larger galaxies. 8. Dwarf galaxies frequently lose their stars to their larger neighbors via gravity. The stars stream across the sky as the dwarf galaxies are ripped apart. Alas, you can't see it with the naked eye. 9. You also can't see the enormous black hole lurking in the center of the Milky Way, though if you've ever looked at the con-stellation Sagittarius, the archer, you've looked in the right direction. 10. Most galaxies have a black hole at the center, and astronomers have found the mass is consistently about 1/1000th the mass of the host galaxy. 11. Two of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way — the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Large Magellanic Cloud — may not have black holes. Or, because both are low-mass galaxies, their central black holes may be too small to detect. 12. Every galaxy does have dust, though. Produced by stars, the dust causes light to look redder than it really is when observed visually, which can make it difficult for astronomers studying properties of stars. 13. That dust can really travel, too. Some galaxies drive galactic winds, expelling dust and gas at hundreds of kilometers per sec-ond into the intergalactic medium, the space between galaxies. 14. These winds are caused by starlight exerting pressure on the dust and gas; the fastest galactic winds are in distant galaxies that are forming stars more rapidly than the Milky Way. 15. The Milky Way rotates at about 250 kilometers per second (about 560,000 mph) and completes a full revolution about every 200 million years. 16. One galactic revolution ago, dinosaurs ruled the Earth. 17. Galaxies rotate faster than predicted based on the gravity of their stars alone. Astronomers infer that the extra gravitational force is coming from dark matter, which does not emit or reflect light. 18. Dark matter aside, galaxies are mostly empty space. If the stars within galaxies were shrunk to the size of oranges, they would be separated by 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles). 19. If galaxies were shrunk to the size of apples, neighboring galaxies would only be a few meters apart. The relative proximity of galaxies means that galaxies occasionally merge. 20. In about 4 billion years, the Milky Way will merge with the Andromeda galaxy. The result of the merging process — which will take at least a hundred million years — will be an ellipsoidal galaxy nicknamed "Milkomeda." ©Copyright 2014 The Rose City Astronomers.

Page 7 IDA Issues New Standards on Blue Light at Night New rules strengthen IDA's Fixture Seal of Approval program. Tucson, AZ - Dec. 1, 2014 - The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is pleased to announce new requirements for "dark sky friendly" light fixtures certified through its Fixture Seal of Approval (FSA) program. Created nearly a decade ago, the FSA program is regarded by industry leaders as an essential certification for outdoor lighting and continues to evolve as new research and metrics become available. The FSA program encourages lighting manufacturers to design responsible outdoor lighting. IDA-approved light fixtures have undergone an objective, third party assessment to ensure they are fully shielded and have minimal nega-tive impacts on the night environment. The FSA logo assures consumers that they are purchasing environmentally friendly lighting. The new FSA program requirements are designed to provide even greater protection of the night environment. Until now, FSA criteria only required fixtures to be fully shielded and emit light downward. The advent of new lighting technologies, particularly light-emitting diodes (LEDs), has raised concerns about the potential negative ef-fects of blue-rich white light, even from fixtures with proper shielding. Exposure to blue light at night has known negative effects on ecology and is thought to cause certain kinds of chronic disease in humans. It can increase glare compromising human vision, especially in the aging eye. The blue component of outdoor white LED lighting also increases light pollution more than older lighting technologies. IDA warned of these hazards in its 2010 white paper, "Visibility, Environmental, and Astronomical Issues Asso-ciated with Blue-Rich White Outdoor Lighting." Since the report was issued, evidence supporting its findings has continued to grow. The FSA program's new standards address these concerns by limiting the amount of blue-rich light in the nighttime environment. FSA approval now requires that products offer a listed correlated color temperature (CCT) configuration of 3000K or lower. Previously approved products will have one year to comply with the new standard. As new research emerges, IDA will continue to reassess FSA standards and expects to further strengthen the program guidelines in the future. "IDA is working to drive the lighting industry toward limiting the amount of blue light at night," said IDA Acting Executive Director Scott Kardel. "We will be tightening the program requirements even further as time goes on." Since the program's inception, the market for FSA-approved public and industrial lighting has grown exponential-ly. Manufacturers at industry trade shows display the FSA logo on many of their products. Builders, architects, and city planners who attend these shows can choose from a variety of dark sky-friendly products, including LEDs, in-duction lighting, and high-pressure sodium fixtures. Residential customers can now easily find FSA-approved light-ing at major hardware retailers. IDA has also been instrumental in driving product development for lighting in ecologically sensitive areas. As a result, many of these new technologies are now being introduced to the general marketplace. IDA is actively involved in developing lighting recommendations for sensitive coastal areas where significant populations of endangered sea turtles nest and hatch. In 2015 IDA will launch a new Sea Turtle Friendly product certification to complement the new FSA requirements. Learn more at http://www.darksky.org/fsa.

A planet of extremes, during its day facing the sun, its surface temperature tops 800°F—hot enough to melt lead—but during the night, the temperature plunges to -270°F, way colder than dry ice. Frozen water may exist at its poles. And its day (from sunrise to sunrise) is twice as long as its year. Now add more weirdness measured by NASA's recent MESSENGER spacecraft: Mercury's magnetic field in its northern hemisphere is triple its strength in the southern hemisphere. Numerical models run by postdoctoral researcher Hao Cao, working in the lab of Christopher T. Russell at UC Los Angeles, offer an explanation: inside Mercury's mol-ten iron core it is "snowing," and the resultant convection is so powerful it causes the planet's magnetic dynamo to break symmetry and concentrate in one hemisphere. "Snowing" inside Mercury With a diameter only 40 percent greater than the Moon's, Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system (now that Pluto was demoted). But its gravitational field is more than double the Moon's. Why? Mercury has an absolutely gigantic iron core, accounting for 85 percent of the planet's radius—about the size of the entire Moon. Only the planet's outermost 15 percent is a silicate mantle. Most of that iron is molten. Just the innermost core is solid: its size is unknown, but more on this in a bit. The molten iron is mixed with lighter elements, of which silicon and sulfur are most abundant. In 2008, other scientists showed that when iron is mixed with a lighter element under intense pressures likely reached partway inside Mercury's molten core, there is a zone where solid iron will spontaneously precipitate in fine flakes like iron filings, drifting down like snow toward the solid core. At the same time, buoyant lighter elements will also separate from the iron as a liquid and will float upwards as fine droplets toward the mantle. Inside Mercury there may be two distinct "snow zones." In both cases, as solid iron falls and the lighter elements rise, their convective action stirs this gigantic molten iron core, bending and stretching magnetic field lines, driving an energetic planetary dynamo. Planetary dynamos are thought to be helical (spiral) flows of a magnetized fluid along columns parallel to the planet's axis of rotation; molten iron in the case of the rocky inner planets. A given column can spiral any of four combinations of directions: either clockwise or counterclockwise while flowing toward the poles or toward the equator. The question is what happens at the planet's equator. Spin flip Inside Earth, in any single column both the northward and southward flows on both sides of the equator are spiraling in the same direction (say, clockwise and toward the equator). In a neighboring column, the flows all spiral in the opposite direction (say, counter-clockwise and toward the poles). That flow configuration is called an "even" mode. If convective stirring is much stronger than Earth's, fluid mechanics predicts that a planet's molten iron core can also host an "odd" mode where the section of each column south of the equator spins in the opposite direction from the section north of the equator—that is, they reverse vorticity at the equator. But the numerical simulations reveal that with really, really strong convective stirring—as would happen if a planet's entire molten core is pervaded with convective iron snow—something dramatic happens: the odd and even modes overlap, spontane-ously breaking symmetry and enhancing helicity in one hemisphere at the expense of the other. "Unlike the Earth's dynamo..., Mercury's dynamo is likely powered by uniformly distributed buoyancy sources within the liquid core," the authors conclude. The model also predicts a size for Mercury's inner core: small. In the simulations, a Mercury-like asymmetric magnetic field developed only when the solid inner core was less than half the radius of the molten outer core-mantle boundary. –Trudy E.
