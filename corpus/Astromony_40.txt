Swanson, The NexStar User's Guide II, The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-64933-7 Glossary Words in italics are defined elsewhere in the Glossary. AFOV See apparent field of view. Airy disk The image of a star as seen through a tele-scope. Although a star is a pinpoint of light, due to the interaction of light and optics, it appears as a very small disk surrounded by one or more faint diffraction rings. Viewing the Airy disk requires good optics, steady see-ing, and a well- collimated 'scope. Alt-azimuth or altitude-azimuth A method of mounting a telescope so that motion is allowed left to right (azimuth) and up and down (altitude). Apparent field of view (AFOV) The apparent angular slice shown by an eye-piece. A larger AFOV yields a "wider" view, while a narrow AFOV is often likened to viewing through a drinking straw. See also field of view and true field of view. Aperture The diameter of a telescope's objective (main lens or mirror). Larger apertures provide greater light-gathering power (the ability to show fainter objects) and higher resolution (the ability to show finer detail). Arcminute A unit used to measure the angular separation of objects in the sky. An arcminute is 1/60th of a degree. Arcsecond A unit used to measure the angular separation of objects in the sky. An arcsecond is 1/60th of an arcminute. 264 Asterism A recognizable pattern of stars – for example, the Big Dipper or the Southern Cross. Asteroid A small, rocky body orbiting the Sun or other star. In our solar system, great concentrations of asteroids are found in orbit between Mars and Jupiter. Averted vision A technique used to see faint objects. By looking to the side of the object, the faint light falls on the more sensi-tive part of the eye. Binary star See double star. Binocular viewers Often simply called "bino viewers." Used with a telescope, this special adapter allows viewing with both eyes. Caldwell catalog 109 deep sky objects to expand beyond the Messier list. Many of these objects are only visible to observers in the Southern Hemisphere. See also Messier catalog. Catadioptric telescope A telescope design using both mirror and lenses, for example, Schmidt-Cassegrain or Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes. Celestial equator An imaginary line on the sky found directly above Earth's equator. Objects north of the celestial equator have a posi-tive declination; objects south have a negative declination. Celestial pole Either of the points in the sky directly above Earth's north or south pole. Collimation Alignment of the optical elements of a telescope, binocu-lar, or other optical device. Comet A celestial body, made mostly of ice and rock, usually orbiting a star in a highly elliptical orbit. Compound telescope Another name, and easier to pronounce than catadiop-tric, for a telescope design using both mirror and lenses. Schmidt- Cassegrain or Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes are examples. Corrector plate The large lens on the front of Schmidt- Cassegrain or Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes. The corrector on a Maksutov- Cassegrain is also called the meniscus lens. Crescent Moon A lunar phase when less than a quarter of the surface of the Moon visible from Earth is illuminated. DEC See declination. Declination A measurement, in degrees, of an object's angular dis-tance from the celestial equator. Objects north of the celestial equator have a positive declination; objects south of the celestial equator have a negative declination. Used together with right ascension, it provides the pre-cise location of an object in the sky. Deep sky object Objects outside of our solar system are known collec-tively as deep sky objects, or DSOs. DSOs range from individual stars to cities of stars known as galaxies. Refer to Chap. 2 for more details. Glossary https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64933-7_2 265 Degree A unit used to measure the angular separation of objects in the sky. There are 360° measured around a complete circle. Double star A star that can be resolved with optical aid to show two stars. Multiple stars are also found with three or more members. Some are binary/multiple systems with the mem-ber stars revolving around a common center of gravity. Others are merely an optical effect with member stars sepa-rated by great distances but coincidentally in a common line of sight as viewed from Earth. DSO See deep sky object. Ecliptic The line in the sky that the planets, the Moon, and the Sun travel along. The line resembles a sine wave – 23° above the celestial equator at its high point, 23° below the celes-tial equator at its low point. The course and seasonal orien-tation of the line are due to the 23° tilt of Earth's axis and Earth's path around the Sun. ep or e.p. Sometimes used as an abbreviation for eyepiece. Equatorial mount A method of mounting a telescope so that one of the axes (called the right ascension axis) is aligned with Earth's axis. The other axis (called the declination axis) is mounted at a 90° angle to the first. This allows easy tracking of the sky as Earth rotates on its axis. The most common are fork-mounted 'scopes on a wedge or the German Equatorial Mount (GEM). Exit pupil The size, in millimeters, of the column of light projecting from the eyepiece of a telescope or binoculars. Refer to Chap. 2 for additional details. Field of view (FOV) The view in the eyepiece of a telescope or binoculars. Typical usage: "The Orion Nebula filled the entire field of view." Refer to Chaps. 2 and 8 for more details. Focal length Traditionally describes the measured distance from the main objective (lens or mirror) of an optical instrument to the point where the image is brought to a focus. For compound telescopes such as Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov-Cassegrain, the complex curves of the corrector and mirrors fold and compress the light path so that a relatively short optical tube projects a longer effective focal length. Focal ratio The result of dividing the focal length of a telescope by its aperture. Focal ratio is written "f/number." For example, the NexStar 102SLT has a focal length of 660 mm and an aperture of 102 mm, resulting in a focal ratio of approxi-mately f/6.5 (660/102 = 6.47). Focal reducer An optical adapter that effectively decreases the focal length of a telescope. Sometimes called a telecompressor or reducer/corrector.

Full Moon The phase of the Moon when the entire illumi-nated portion of the Moon is facing Earth. Galaxy A grouping of hundreds of millions or even billions of stars bound together by gravity and traveling together through space. There are bil-lions of galaxies in the universe. GEM See equatorial mount. Gibbous Moon A lunar phase area when more than half of the surface of the Moon visible from Earth is illuminated. Globular cluster A group of hundreds of thousands of stars bound together by gravity. IC catalog 5,386 objects cataloged by J.L.E. Dreyer. In addition to individual and double stars, the majority of DSOs of interest to amateur astron-omers are found in this or the NGC catalog. Local sidereal time The hour, minute, and second of right ascen-sion directly overhead at any instant. Magnitude A measurement of the brightness of a celestial object as viewed from any given location (such as Earth). Smaller numbers indicate brighter objects, with negative numbers being the brigh-test. Refer to Chap. 2 for more details. Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope Sometimes called Maksutov or simply Mak. A telescope design using mirrors and a deeply curved corrector plate to create a compact instrument with a relatively long focal length. For a more detailed description and figure, refer to Chap. 2. Meniscus lens Also called corrector plate, refers to the large lens on the front of Maksutov- Cassegrain telescopes. Meridian An imaginary line drawn from due south, directly overhead, and then due north. Messier catalog 110 DSOs of various types of objects. Most of the brighter deep sky objects visible in the Northern Hemisphere are listed in Charles Messier's catalog. Generally, these objects are the first DSO targets for beginning amateur astronomers. Messier 1 would be commonly referred to as "M1." Meteor A small particle that enters Earth's atmosphere, burning away with a streak of light. Glossary https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64933-7_2 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64933-7_2 267 Meteorite A small metal or rocky object that enters Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface before being completely consumed by the heat. Nebula A huge cloud of dust and/or gas found in space. Refer to Chap. 2 for more details. New Moon The phase of the Moon when the entire illumi-nated portion of the Moon is facing away from Earth. Thus, the unlit side of the Moon faces us. Newtonian reflector telescope A telescope design using a large concave mirror and a small flat mirror to gather and focus light. For a more detailed des cription and figure, refer to Chap. 2. NGC catalog 7,840 objects cataloged by J.L.E. Dreyer. In addition to individual and double stars, the majority of DSOs of interest to amateur astrono-mers are found in this or the IC catalog. Open cluster A group of less than a few hundred stars loosely bound by their mutual gravity. Most are slowly drifting apart and are relatively young. Parfocal A characteristic of two or more eyepieces that allows them to be exchanged in a telescope with little or no refocusing required. R/C Reducer/corrector. See focal reducer. RA See right ascension. Reducer/corrector See focal reducer. Reflector telescope A telescope design that utilizes a mirror for the main optical component. See New tonian reflector, Schmidt- Cassegrain, and Maksutov-Cassegrain for examples. Refractor telescope The oldest telescope design. Uses a lens for the main optical component. For a more detailed description and figure, refer to Chap. 2. Resolution Smallest detail able to be detected in an optical device. Usually measured in arcseconds. Right ascension Lines drawn against the sky running from the north celestial pole to the south celestial pole. Abbreviated RA. Right ascension changes as we move "east" and "west" in the sky. Right ascen-sion is measured in hours, minutes, and seconds. The entire sky is divided into 24 hours, each hour is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute is divided into 60 seconds. Used together with declination, provides the precise location of an object in the sky.

The port on the bot-tom of many NexStar hand controls is RS-232 compatible. The computer indus-try is replacing RS-232 with newer stan-dards such as USB. See Chap. 7 for more details. Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) A telescope design using mirrors and a relatively flat corrector plate to create a compact instrument with a long focal length. For a more detailed description and figure, refer to Chap. 2. SCT See Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Seeing conditions The overall quality of the local atmo-sphere as it affects celestial observations. The three main factors affecting seeing conditions are known as transparency, seeing, and light pollution. Transparency is affected by particles in the air such as moisture, dust, pollution, etc. Seeing is the effect of unsteady air – basically air turbulence. Light pollution is caused by the enormous amount of light that civi-lization sends into the night sky. The brightness of the Moon has a similar affect. For more details, refer to Chap. 2. Serial port A name commonly used for an RS-232 port on a computer. See Chap. 7 for more details. Sidereal rate The rate at which the stars move across the sky. Each star takes a little less than 24 hours to make a complete circuit around the sky. Slew Technically, any movement of a telescope upon its mount, but more commonly used to indicate moving a 'scope with the motors on the mount. Terminator The line dividing the light and dark halves of a planetary body. Generally considered most important with the Moon, since lunar features are most strik-ing along the terminator. TFOV See true field of view. Transparency See seeing conditions.

In any given telescope, the true field of view changes as you use various eyepieces. Refer to Chaps. 2 and 8 for more details. USB Short for Universal Serial Bus. The modern replace-ment for the RS-232 serial port. All new computers are equipped with USB ports and many no longer come with an RS-232 port. See Chap. 7 for more details. Variable star A star that changes magnitude (brightness) by a mea-surable degree. Some are caused by unstable nuclear reactions. Others are actually binary or double star systems resulting in lesser magnitude when both stars align with our line of sight. Vignette Darkening around the edges of the field of view, usu-ally most noticeable in astrophotographs. Generally, this is caused by using an equipment combination that exceeds the maximum possible field of view for a telescope. Visual back The 1.25-inch or 2-inch adapter on the back of a Schmidt-Cassegrain or Maksutov- Cassegrain tele-scope. Typically, a diagonal is placed into the visual back to allow comfortable viewing. Waning Moon Any phase of the Moon after the full moon and prior to the new moon. Thus, the Moon is "shrinking" in phase each night. Waxing Moon Any phase of the Moon after the new moon and prior to the full moon. Thus the Moon is "growing" in phase each night. Wedge An adapter placed between the tripod and a fork-mounted telescope to allow polar alignment. Zenith The point directly overhead.
