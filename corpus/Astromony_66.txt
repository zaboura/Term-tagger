What is an Equatorial Mount? In the northern hemisphere, stars appear to turn around the polar star (the north celestial pole) making approximately one rotation per day. This is called diurnal motion and occurs because the earth turns on its own axis once a day. The equatorial mount is a platform which is designed to rotate parallel to earth's rotational axis. Every movement of the electrically driven SXD2 Mount is fully controlled by the STAR BOOK TEN hand controller. The mount will perform smooth and accurate movements when each component on the mount is balanced correctly. An unbalanced mount may cause vibrations and can result in tracking errors or failure of rotational mechanisms. Make sure that the telescope is well balanced. Do not rotate the mount manually without loosening the clamp levers. The SXD2 mount has clamps which allow you to rotate the Right Ascension (R.A) and Declination (DEC) axes freely for quick set up for home position and compact storage of the mount. Remember to tighten the clamp levers when you usethe mount. The clamp levers should be loosened to protect the inner gear train for storage and when you transport the mount. Never connect the STAR BOOK cable to other equipment such as a PC. This could result in electrical shock, fire, or damage to the equipment. (The specifications of the STAR BOOK cable are not compatible with RS232C (D-SUB 9PIN) connectors.) Be careful not to bang the mount against other objects. This could damage the gears and bearings.

Attaching the Counterweight Lock Lever Lock Screw Lock Screw Safety Screw Safety Screw Far Side Counterweight Counterweight Bar 1Loosen the counterweight bar lock lever to draw out the counterweight bar. Tighten the counterweight bar lock lever with the counterweight bar extended fully. 2Remove the safety screw on the end of the counterweight bar. Loosen the lock screw on the side of a counterweight and install the counterweight by sliding it onto the counterweight bar. 3Attach the counterweight so that the lock screw on the counterweight is on the far side of the safety screw as shown in the figure. 4Tighten the counterweight lock screw and replace the safety screw to screw it down on the end of the counterweight bar tightly. The counterweight bar is in the declination body. You may balance the SXD2 mount with only the counterweight bar to start. Tips on Assembling the Mount Generally equatorial mounts are heavier on the declination axis side. Because of this feature, placing the SXD2 mount so that its declination axis comes directly over one of the tripod legs can make it most stable when you use the SXD2 mount for a north (or south) latitude of 50 degrees and lower. However, the balance of the SXD2 mount may vary if it is used in latitude higher than 50 degrees. This may result in shifting the center of balance to the opposite side of the declination axis depending on the location of the loading equipment. Change the position of the tripod legs so that the SXD2 mount becomes more stable in such a case. 14 Chapter 1 PREPARATION IV. Attaching the Optical Tube Attaching to the Saddle Plate Attaching to the Dovetail-plate Mounting Block Safety Screw Safety Screw Lock Knob Lock Knob Optical Tube Dovetail-plate Tube Plate Make sure that the slide bar or dovetail tube plate is flat against the saddle plate. Tightening the lock screws with a gap between these parts may cause the telescope to fall. 1Loosen the two lock knobs on the saddle plate before you attach the optical tube. 2Slide the dovetail bar on the bottom of the optical tube onto the sunken platform of the saddle plate. 3Tighten the two lock knobs on the saddle plate securely. 1Loosen the lock knob and the safety screw on the mount head before you attach the optical tube. 2Slide the dovetail tube-plate mounted optical tube onto the sunken platform of the mount head. 3Tighten the lock knob onto the dovetail tube-plate centering notch until snug. Tighten the safety screw securely. 2-22-2 33 1-11-1 2-12-11-21-2 15 1Loosen the R.A clamp lever while holding the counterweight bar (1-1) and turn the telescope tube until the DEC axis comes to horizontal (1-2). Tighten the R.A clamp lever and loosen the DEC clamp lever. Be sure to hold the optical tube or counterweight securely while loosening the clamps. 2Release the telescope gradually to see which way the telescope rotates around the declination axis. If the telescope tube starts rotating as you release, it shows there is an imbalance in DEC To determine the balance point, loosen the lock knob that hold the telescope tube to the dovetail-plate moun-ting block and slide the telescope tube either forward or backward until it remains stationary. 3Tighten the lock knob (and the safety screw) securely to hold the telescope tube in place. 4Tighten the DEC clamp to finish this adjustment. Chapter 1 PREPARATION CAUTION CAUTION V . Balancing the Equatorial mount Telescope Tube with Dovetail Slide Bar Balancing the Mount in Declination Do not loosen the lock knob too much in balancing. This could cause the telescope to detach or lead to injury. Take care not to drop the optical tube assembly as it could seriously damage the equipment or lead to injury. Pay close attention to the security of the telescope tube and do not excessively loosen the lock knobs on the equipment. Lock Knob Lock Knob Counterweight Bar R.A Clamp DEC Clamp Standstill Decl. Axis Why Balance the Mount? The Vixen SXD2 mount is a German equatorial mount, in which the rotating RA axis and rotating DEC axis cross each other at right angle. The axes are rotated by using movements of gears on the each axis to get maximum stability and limit the stress on the gears. If the equatorial mount is in an unbalanced state, it will increase stress to the gears and this could result in damage or erratic operation. Precise slewing requires a high level of accuracy in rotation of both axes and is important in eliminating stress to the gears. Make sure to balance the equatorial mount properly in RA and DEC accordingly. An optical tube weighing 1.3kg (2.8 lb.) or less will not balance with the SXD2 mount. 16 Chapter 1 PREPARATION Telescope Tube with Tube Rings CAUTION Do not move the counterweight too much in balancing. This could damage the telescope tube or lead to injury. Lock Knob Lock Knob Lock Screw AX103S shown R200SS shown Standstill Decl. Axis Counterweight 1Loosen the R.A clamp while holding the counterweight bar (1-1) and turn the telescope tube until the DEC axis comes to horizontal (1-2). Tighten the R.A clamp and loosen the DEC clamp. Be sure to hold the optical tube or counterweight in hand while loosening the clamps. 2Release the telescope gradually to see which way the telescope rotates around the declination axis. If the tele-scope tube starts rotating as you release, it shows there is an imbalance in DEC To determine the balance point, loosen the tube ring lock knobs that hold the telescope tube and slide the tele-scope tube either forward or backward until it remains stationary. 3Tighten the tube ring lock knobs (and the safety screw if any) securely to hold the telescope tube in place. 4Tighten the DEC clamp to finish this adjustment. CAUTION Do not loosen the lock knobs too much in balancing. This could cause the telescope to fall or lead to injury. 1Loosen the R.A clamp lever while holding the counterweight bar and turn the telescope tube until the DEC axis comes to horizontal as shown in the figure. 2Release the telescope tube gradually to see which way the telescope rotates around the R.A axis. If the telescope tube starts moving by its own weight as you release, it shows there is an imbalance in the R.A While holding the counterweight bar, loosen the lock knob on the counterweight so that it can be moved to a point where it balances the telescope tube. This is the point at which the telescope remains stationary when the R.A clamp is loose. If your telescope is light in weight, the mount may balance without the supplied counterweight. (The extended counterweight bar itself can act as a counterweight.) Retract the counterweight bar for further balance adjustment. 3Tighten the lock knob on the counterweight to hold in place. 4Tighten the R.A clamp on the mount securely.

Pressing the key will return the screen to the initial setting menu at this stage. 4Your telescope is ready to slew to all directions as soon as the telescope's home position setting screen is displayed on the screen. The and direction keys move your telescope in the direction of the R.A The and direction keys on the right side of the STAR BOOK TEN move the telescope in the direction of the DEC You can slew the telescope at different speeds through use of the direction keys. Default slewing speed: 500x of the sidereal rate at a maximum Note: If the slewing speed is set at level 3 or below in "System Menu", the maximum available slewing speed is restricted within 400x of the sidereal rate. For using other speed levels, refer to "Mount Setting" section in Chapter 5. In the telescope's home position setting screen, pressing either of the zoom keys on the left side of the STAR BOOK TEN will quickly vary the maximum slewing speed. The upper key will decrease the motor speed and the lower key will increase the motor speed. These keys are useful in SCOPE MODE when you need a slow motion at high magnification or a quick motion at low magnification. Note: The mount does not start celestial tracking while the initial setting screen is displayed. The celestial tracking starts at the same time the star chart appears on the screen. ★ Startup Procedure 24 Chapter 4 AUTOMATIC GOTO SLEWING Automatic Go-To Slewing Startup Procedure The moon and bright planets are found readily in the night sky as you can locate their positions with ease. However, less bright planets, nebulae and star clusters are dim and mostly invisible with the unaided eye. Even if you know where these dim and blurred objects are in the night sky, it often takes time and effort to look for them. The automatic Go-To slewing with the STAR BOOK TEN will assist you in locating celestial objects easily and quickly. It appears that the positions of stars relative to each other in the sky are all but fixed due to their extrmemly long distances from us on the earth. Because of this, the star's positions on celestial spheres can be measured on star maps using celestial coordinates. The right ascention of the celestial spheres corresponds to latitude and the declination corresponds to altitude on the geograhic maps. The STAR BOOK TEN acts as a celestial navigator like your car navigation system. Celestial Object Celestial Equator Declination (Degree) Celestial Pole Polaris Equinox Ecliptic Right Ascension (Hour Angle) Point the mount toward the north celestial pole in the northern hemisphere (the south in the southern hemisphere) so that the R.A axis on the mount is parallel with the axis of the celestial sphere in your observing location. Loosen the clams on the R.A and declination axes and move the telescope to the home position by hand. Point the optical tube to due west horizon in the northern hemisphere (due east horizon in the southern hemisphere) to fix the home position. Select two stars from the list in the STAR BOOK TEN to align the telescope. The more alignment stars you select, the more centrally located the target objects will be in your telescope's field of view. Choose your target on the screen of the star chart or from the database of extensive celestial objects in the menu and slew the telescope to your target. Enjoy your observing!

Home Position About Home Position Guideposts After setting up the telescope, locate the SXD2 mount so that its R.A axis points toward the north celestial pole if you use the telescope in the northern hemisphere. If your intention is not to take lengthy astrophotography, you don't need to align the R.A axis to the celestial pole precisely. A rough setting will work well for visual observation. While looking for the polar star, locate the mount so that it faces toward the north and the elevation of the R.A axis matches the latitude of your observing site. • Loosening the adjustment screw on one side will allow you to tighten the screw on the other side to change the altitude and azimuth directions. • If you use the telescope in the southern hemisphere, locate the SXD2 mount so that the R.A axis points toward the south celestial pole and set the elevation of the mount to be equal to the latitude of your observing site. Azimuth Adjustment Knobs Altitude Adjustment Knobs Reading Guide Altitude Scale 1Flipping on the power switch on the bottom of the declination body of the SXD2 mount will turn on the STAR BOOK TEN. Complete all the initial settings such as time and location. Advance the screen on the STAR BOOK TEN until the image shown on the right appears on it. Use an eyepiece with magnification as low as possible. Note: If the star chart is already displayed on the screen, turn off the power switch and reboot the STAR BOOK TEN to start from the initial setup screen 2In the "Initial Configuration" menu, choose OK with the or key and press the key. The "Solar Warning" notice appears on the screen. Choose "Confirm" with the or key and press the key to advance. The home position setting appears on the screen and the mount is now ready to move in all directions using the the • • • direction keys. The mount does not start tracking at the celestial rate during this stage. 3Loosen the R.A and Declination lock clamps on the mount and position the telescope's optical tube so that it points toward the west and is level. Refer to the image of the telescope displayed on the screen to understand it correctly. When you fix the position of the optical tube, tighten the R.A and declination lock clamps on the mount. After this, do not touch the lock clamps until you finish your observing. The home position is the first posi-tioning of your telescope to determine. Set the home position by measuring with your eye as close as possible. The SXD2 mount has guideposts on the R.A and Declination individually. The guideposts are useful when you position the telescope tube to be level toward west in the northern hemisphere (toward east in the southern hemisphere).

What is CHART MODE? 1After determining the home position of your telescope, press the key to display the interactive dialog box on the screen. The dialog box asks you if you enter SCOPE MODE. Choose OK with the or key and press the key. 2The star chart in SCOPE MODE appears on the screen. The concentric target circles in the center of the star chart indicate due west. (The target circles indicate due east in the southern hemisphere.) The SXD2 mount starts tracking at the celestial rate from that point and now the Go-To slewing will accurately bring a target object in the finder scope's field of view. You need to proceed to star alignment to set the pointing accuracy of your telescope. After this, CHART MODE and SCOPE MODE will switch over each time you press the key while the star chart is displayed on the screen. Its status is displayed at the upper left on the screen. Pressing the key in CHART MODE will ask you to proceed to the Go-To slewing. The star alignment matches celestial coordinates of stars memorized as location information in the STAR BOOK TEN with positions of stars that can be really seen in the sky. The location information is identified with a star and this paring is called "getting an alignment point". CHART MODE and SCOPE MODE can switch over each time you press the key. SCOPE MODE is linked with the movements of your telescope. The top and bottom of the screen are highlighted in red in SCOPE MODE. The telescope follows the target circles on the starscreen as you scroll the star chart with the • • • direction keys in SCOPE MODE. The Go-To slewing is simple with the command keys. CHART MODE is independent from the movements of your telescope. The top and bottom of the screen are highlighted in blue in CHART MODE. With no linkage to the telescope, scrolling of the chart is quick and easy with the • • • direction keys. Go-To slewing is readily available with the command keys. Additionally, you can look for a target directly on the star chart in this mode. The screen will turn to SCOPE MODE as soon as the telescope gets to the target. 27 Chapter 4 AUTOMATIC GOTO SLEWING Note: If the "Go-To message" is set to off, the Go-To slewing will start at once without confirmation. This chapter assumes that the "Go-To message" is set to on. 3 Select a star from an alignment stars list in the object database. Be sure to select alignment stars for which you recognize locations in the night sky. Aldebaran in Taurus, the Bull is shown here as an example of the first alignment star. In SCOPE MODE, press the command key (or the command key to access "Star" in "Object Menu" with the or key, and press the key). Select stars that are available for alignment (stars marked with ◎ are seen above the horizon.) with the or direction key and press the key. The dialog box appears to confirm if you are ready to slew the telescope to the target you selec-ted. Choose OK and press the key to start the Go-To slewing. At the same time, the target is marked and a position of the first alignment star is indicated on the bottom of the screen by its coordinate. The telescope starts moving toward the target. (Go-To is indicated on the lower right of the screen.) Go-To slewing is completed. As soon as the Go-To slewing finishes, the STAR BOOK TEN rings the chimes and the slewing speed is changed to the sidereal rate. 28 Chapter 4 AUTOMATIC GOTO SLEWING 4Your first Go-To slewing may not bring the alignment star in the main telescope's field of view but should appear in the finder scope. Here, center Aldebaran in the telescope's field of view as an example with the following procedure. Move the telescope with the • • • direction keys so that you bring Aldebaran to the center of the finder scope's field of view. Magnifying the star chart with the zoom key will slow the motion of the telescope and thus allow you to make finer adjustments of the position. Bring Aldebaran in the center of the finder scope's field of view and look for it in the telescope's field of view. After you place the target in the finder scope's field of view, use an eyepiece with low magnification (A larger number eyepiece in millimeters such as a NLV20mm) to bring it in the field of view of the main telescope. Then, change to an eyepiece with high magnifica-tion (A smaller number eyepiece in millimeters such as a NLV5mm) so that you can center the target accurately. Press the key on the STAR BOOK TEN as you have centered Aldebaran in the field of view of the telescope successfully. The dialog box appears to confirm the star alignment with Aldebaran. Choose OK with the or key, and press the key. The fist star alignment has been completed. The target Aldebaran comes to the center cross of the target circles on the screen. 5Proceed to the second star alignment with a different star to increase the pointing accuracy of the telescope. The more star alignments you have, the better your targets are centered. (You can perform a maximum 20 alignment points.) Note: Aldebaran will be away from the center of the target circles on the screen as you move the telescope to look for Aldebaran in the field of view of the telescope. This is caused by a difference between the actual position of Aldebaran viewed and the location of the same star in the database of the STAR BOOK TEN. It is a normal behavior. In this stage of the star alignment, the telescope's field of view corresponds to a correct orientation of the telescope and disregards the position of the target on the screen. Finder scope´s field of view Field of view of the Telescope 29 Chapter 4 AUTOMATIC GOTO SLEWING CAUTION Slewing the Telescope to an Object near the Sun or to the Sun Stop the Slewing Quickly Changing the Display Mode When slewing to the object near the Sun, be careful not to have the Sun traverse the field of view of your telescope. Never look directly at the sun with your naked eyes or through the telescope. Permanent and irreversible eye damage may result. Make sure that the finder scope is covered with the objective cap. If you try slewing to an object near the Sun or to the Sun, the STAR BOOK TEN will alert you with a dialog box: "Warning! Target is close to the Sun." In the dialog box, choose OK with the or key and press the key to advance The movements of the telescope will pause if you press any of the keys (except the zoom keys) during the Go-To slewing. Use this option stop the telescope quickly if the optical tube is about to hit something or if you want to cancel the ongoing slewing. At the same time, the dialog box appears to confirm to continue the Go-To slewing. Choose OK or Cancel with the or key, and press the key. Pressing OK will continue the slewing again. Pressing Cancel will stop the slewing on the spot. Then, the target will be cleared. Pressing the key a little longer will switch between CHART MODE and SCOPE MODE alternately. In CHARTMODE, pressing the key a little longer will make the star chart screen key change to SCOPE MODE and vice versa. 30 Chapter 4 AUTOMATIC GOTO SLEWING Tips on Star Alignment • It is advisable to use fixed stars for the alignments. As the distant stars are a fixed point of light and they have no area, you can pinpoint a location for an alignment point. Alignments with the moon, planets, nebulae and star cluster are not as accurate as star alignment with fixed stars. • Choosing several alignment stars which are separated over 10 degrees to other will increase the pointing accuracy of your Go-To slewing. Twenty points are available for the alignment. • The dialog box on the right appears if the selected star for the alignment is located within 10 degrees from the previously aligned stars. If you choose OK, the aligned star less than 10 degrees apart will be deleted and replaced with the latest aligned star. Choose Cancel if you stop the alignment. • The dialog box on the right appears if the star alignment is being done with the same star again. If you choose OK, the star alignment will be overwritten by new one. Choose Cancel if you stop the alignment. • If the pointing accuracy of your telescope has not been improved, delete all the alignment stars and align the telescope from the beginning. • Using stars adjacent to the celestial poles for the star alignment may not contribute to improving the pointing accuracy of your telescope. • Using stars near the horizon for the star alignment may result in disturbing the pointing accuracy of your telescope as it is affected by atmospheric conditions. • Choosing stars from the menu makes your star alignment more accurate than choosing stars from the star chart in CHART MODE. • If the target is not chosen, alignment will not work. • Each position of the aligned stars is defined by altitude and azimuth based on a point in time you aligned. Every alignment star moves toward the west due to the diurnal motion. As a consequence, if the aligned stars move more than 10 degrees (more than 40 minutes in time), the STAR BOOK TEN will accept the same star for alignment. This is a normal behavior. • Calculations for star alignment are based on the most reliable two points among the alignment stars Fixed Stars Nebulae & Star Clusters 3 22 53 *111 31 Chapter 4 AUTOMATIC GOTO SLEWING IV.

How to Use the Polar Axis Scope Polar Axis Scope Components Polar Alignment in the Northern Hemisphere CAUTION * Inaccurate polar alignment could result in trailed stars and field rotation in your imaging device. * It is not possible to use the SXD2 mount in the north latitude over 70 degrees and in the south latitude over 70 degrees. Celestial Pole Polar Axis The polar axis scope is a small telescope that is installed parallel to the R.A axis of the SXD2 Mount that enables you to point precisely to the north (or south) celestial pole. Accurate polar alignment is essential for successful long exposure astrophotography of deep sky objects with the equatorial mount. Check longitude and latitude of your observing site with a GPS system or a map before the polar alignment. The polar axis scope allows you to accurately align the mount to Polaris at 3 arc minutes or less. What is a Polar Axis Scope? 1Set up the telescope on flat and hard ground where you can see Polaris in the sky. Point the polar axis of the SXD2 mount in the direction of north as shown in the figure. Adjust the tripod legs so that will the tripod is as level as possible. 2Take off the declination cap and polar axis cap.

Directing the Octans using Small Magellanic Cloud, Beta Hydrus and Gamma Octantis as pointers Note: : The orientation of the Octans changes depending on the season of year. Octans is a constellation located near the south celestial pole and it can be used to align the Polarie in the southern hemisphere. Unlike Polaris which is a bright 2nd magnitude star adjacent to the north celestial pole, Octans is made up of dark stars about 5th magnitude on average. The nearest star to the south celestial pole is Sigma Octantis, which is one of four stars forming a trapezoid in Octans, visible at 5.5th magnitude. There are a few methods to locate inconspicuous Octans using the surrounding stars. If you cast your eyes a little toward Crux from Small Magellanic Cloud, you will see Beta Hydrus. Going southward from Beta Hydrus will find you Gamma Octans which consists of a row of three stars. Continue on your eyes by the same distance toward the Southern Cross and you will find the four stars of Octans. Draw an imaginary line between the center of Small Magellanic Cloud and Beta Crux and divide it at a ratio of one to two. You will find the four stars of Octans at the divide. Draw an imaginary line straight through the two stars (Alpha and Beta Crux) of the Southern Cross making the vertical line of the cross toward Small Magellanic Cloud. You will find the four stars of Octans at a place about 4.5 times extended from the span of the two stars. γ 2β υ τ σχ γ 3 υ τ σχ γ 2β υ τ σχ γ 3 56 Chapter 5 APPLICATION 1Set up the telescope in a flat and hard ground where you can see Octans in the sky.

If the mount type is chosen as „Equatorial mount without polar setting", the position information collected by the star alignment will be applied for the polar alignment. This will spoil the drift alignment as any drifts from the celestial pole are detected and corrected automatically. Choose „Equatorial mount with polar setting" to avoid these corrections. Also turn off the function of depressing atmospheric refractions. If you align the mount with the provided polar alignment scope correctly, the mount will be able maintain tracking celestial objects within the field of view of your telescope's eyepiece. For astrophotography, it enables you to take exposures of 5 to 10 minutes with a telephoto lens of 200mm focal length or less. However, if you want to take longer exposures than 10 minutes or use a telephoto lens of longer focal length than 200mm, more precise polar align-ment is required. The following method of polar adjustment will be done by watching the movement of a bright star in the eyepiece and it is called drift alignment. 1Align the mount to the north celestial pole by using the polar axis scope. This will save time during the process of drift alignment. 2Align the Mount in AzimuthPrepare an eyepiece with illuminated reticle (cross hairs) or you use a Vixen OR12.5mm with illuminated reticle. Choose a bright star near the celestial equator and near the meridian, and put it in the filed of view of the eyepiece. Turn off the power switch of the mount momen-tarily while looking into the eyepiece to see which direction the star moves. Confirm the west and rotate the eyepiece so that one of the cross hairs is parallel to the east-west direction in the field of view. The figure on the right shows the directions of north, south, east and west in the eyepiece according to a type of your telescope with or without a star diagonal. Lock for south in the sky South West North [Inverted view] East North East West South [Erect View] North West East South (Mirror-Reverse View) The following descriptions are based on a telescope without a star diagonal. Drive the mount at sidereal rate and look into the eyepiece to monitor the drift motion of the star in the north-south direction. If the star drifts north (i.e. moves down due to inverted view), move the mount to east in azimuth. If the star drifts south (i.e. moves up due to inverted view), move the mount to west in azimuth. Adjust the mount with the azimuth adjustment screws. Make appropriate adjustments to the polar axis to eliminate the drift. 3Align the Mount in AltitudeChoose a bright star near celestial equator in east but not too low, and put it in the filed of view of the eyepiece. Turn off the power switch of the mount momentarily while looking into the eyepiece to see in which direction the star moves. Confirm the west and rot-ate the eyepiece so that one of the cross hairs is parallel to the east-west direction in the field of view.

If the star drifts north (i.e. moves toward the upper right to inverted view), move the mount to high in altitude. Adjust the mount with the altitude adjustment screws. Make appropriate adjustments to the polar axis to eliminate the drift The SXD2 mount is set for use in the middle latitude zone (latitude of 35 degrees plus/minus 15 degrees) at Vixen's factory. If your observing site is lower or higher than the range of the middle latitude zone, you need to change the current altitude setting to match the latitude of your observing site. The range of altitude adjustments is divided into three positions (low, middle and high) between 0 degrees and 70 degrees in latitude. 1Remove the optical tube and the counterweights from the mount. 2Loosen the altitude clamp lever on one side of the mount body where no altitude scale is attached, and turn the altitude adjustment knob so that the altitude of the mount comes to a position of 35 degrees. Then, tighten the altitude clamp lever. 3Loosen a bolt beneath the altitude clamp lever with the 5mm Allen wrench and remove it. 4Loosen the altitude clamp lever while holding the mount head with the other hand so that the mount body is moved slowly to high or low position in altitude. 5Move the mount to a position of 55 degrees in altitude if you use the mount in the range of high latitude. Or move the mount to a position of 15 degrees in altitude of you use the mount in the range of low latitude. Tighten the altitude clamp lever. 6Put back the bolt in place and tighten it with the Allen wrench securely. 7Loosen the altitude clamp lever again and turn the altitude adjustment knob so that the mount is set at the latitude of your observing site. 8Tighten the altitude clamp lever and the setting is completed.

SCOPEMODE CHART MODE 11 22 74 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Auto Guide Using the AutoGuider Setting Rates for Compensation Tips for Better Autoguiding The STAR BOOK TEN can be used for auto guiding in conjunction with a CCD video camera installed on a guide scope and a built-in autoguider (sold separately) as an expansion unit for the STAR BOOK TEN. An external autoguider which is compatible with the ST series autoguiders from SBIG is available also. You can set up rates for compensation to guide the telescope accurately. For an operation of the autoguider unit, please refer to instruction manuals provided by the autoguider manufacturer. When you use the Advance Unit or an external autoguider, it is recommended to refrain from using the following functions. • Atmospheric Refraction • P-PEC • Backlash Compensation In addition, the following options are recommendable. Direction Key: X-Y Mount Type: Equatorial with Polar Setting Main Scope Guide Scope CCD Video Camera (D)SLR Camera Monitor External Autoguider STARBOOK TEN What is Auto guiding? Auto guiding allows you to guide a telescope on an equatorial mount automatically by means of an autoguider, which compensates signals from a CCD video camera attached on a guide scope to achieve uniform and precise tracking speed of the equatorial mount. The advantages of the autoguider are most apparent during long-exposure astrophotography. 1In "Mount Setting" menu, choose "AutoGuider" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) to call up the dialog box. 2Move the cursor to available entry spaces and enter values for compensation with the or directionkey. Using the or zoom key will increase or decrease the number 10 each within the range. The value of the compensation can be set between 0 and 99 in one increment both in RA and DEC(0.1x of sidereal rate) Enter a smaller value if you move the mount slower to make small compensation, or enter a larger value if you move the mount faster to make a larger compensation. The optimum value for the compensation may vary according to equipment used. Choose the most effective rate to make your auto guiding smoothest. 3Then, press the key twice (or press the key twice alternatively) to save and leave the dialog box. If autoguiding signals are detected by the STAR BOOK TEN through its autoguider port for corrections, the direction key corresponding to the input signal will light to indicate the status of the operation visually. The illustration above shows the autoguider compensates signals in the R.A- (descending) direction. 0 : Keep sidereal rate (No compensation is made.) 1 : ±0.1x of sidereal rate 2 : ±0.2x of sidereal rate 3 : ±0.3x of sidereal rate : : 99 : ±9.9x of sidereal rate Power Source Power Source Power Source Power Source The setting is defaulted to „RA: 10" and „DEC: 10". 22 554433 75 Chapter 5 APPLICATION PEC (Periodic Error Correction) Starting the PEC Recording The period of time for the PEC recording is 8 minutes (480 seconds). Equatorial mounts with drive motors are designed to precisely track the motion of celestial objects. With the use of a telescope mounted on the equatorial mount, you may notice that stars in the field of view of the telescope at high magnification are drifting back and forth very slowly over a period of time (e.g. 384 seconds with SXD2 mount) in the direction of R.A This is caused by the motion of the tracking gear wheels and it is part of the design of equatorial mounts. The PEC (periodic error correction) rectifies this phenomenon on the equatorial mount and records the correction electronically. The tracking accuracy varies in irregular motion and must be corrected as precisely as possible. Note: The SXD2 mount does not detects a start point of the PEC recording until the R.A and Declination axes are rotated electorically at an angle of one degree and more. Pay attention to it if you start the PEC recording immediately after you turn on the mount. 1Choose "Equatorial with Polar Setting" in the Mount Type described on page 82. Accurately polar align the mount. 2Prepare an eyepiece with crosshairs such as a Vixen OR-12.5mm with illuminated reticle. Put a guide star on the center of the crosshairs in the eyepiece. Go to high magnification with an eyepiece as high as 200x and more. 3In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "PEC" with the or direction key and press the key to call up the dialog box. 4In the "PEC" dialog box, choose "Rec Start" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) 5The PEC recording starts with chimes after counting down 3 seconds. Tracking the guide star very carefully as your corrections during manual operation are recorded. 6On starting the PEC recording, the speed of correction is fixed at 0.5 times of sidereal rate regardless of an enlargement or reduction of the star chart. The • zoom keys allow enlarging or reducing the star chart on the screen during the PEC recording. During the PEC recording the count number is displayed in red at the left corner of the information bar on the bottom of the screen. The counter starts from 479 and counts down every second to 0 and repeat. Tracking ON PEC on recording (red) 7A cycle of the PEC recording ends with another chime as soon as the 480 seconds has elapsed, but the duration of the recording continues until you stop it. The PEC recording is renewed in each cycle. Note: You can complete the PEC recording per cycle and it must be started from a defined starting point. If you can't start the PEC recording right after turning on the power of the SXD2 mount, rotate the mount electrically more than one degree in both R.A and DEC to detect the starting point.

All the recorded PEC are erased. 78 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Backlash Compensation Backlash is a momentary stoppage of the tracking motion of the mount that occurs when the motor gears reverse their rotation. Backlash does not occur while the mount moves at a constant speed as the gears keep contact with each other. Backlash may occur when the telescope is moved with the direction keys manually. The backlash compensation provides a reduced time lag at the point of reversed motion where the gears lose the contact. It gives smoother rotation of the gears on the mount. Checking the Backlash It is convenient to use a bright 1st-magnitude star in order to check a backlash amount for compensation. Celestial Pole Polar AxisNorth Guide Star Field of View 1Precisely polar align the mount. 2In SCOPE MODE, choose the motor speed to be set approximately between 1.2x and 4.0x with the or zoom key with looking at the right corner of the information bar on the bottom of the screen. 3Confirm the amount of backlash in the direction of R.A as follows. Center the 1st-magnitude star in the field of view of your eyepiece and watch how the star moves while pressing the direction key. Press the direction key until the star begins to move. 4Press the direction key to watch how the star moves in the field of view. If there is a time lag and the star does not begin to move instantly toward the direction you press, a value for the backlash compensa-tion is set too small (weak) or set to "0". On the contrary, if the star begins to move quickly and becomes larger at the same time you press, a value for the backlash compensa-tion is set too large (strong). 5Confirm the amount of backlash in the direction of DEC in the same way with the • direction keys. CAUTION Backlash compensation is not compatible with an autoguider in most cases. Cancel using this option when you use an autoguider. The setting is defaulted to „RA: 0" and „DEC: 0". 79 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Tips on Setting of Backlash Compensation Watch how the telescope moves when you increase the value. Start with setting an initial reference value (10 for example), and double this value after checking the telescope movement with the initial value. If the second value (=20) is too small to compensate for the backlash, enter the number doubled (=40) as the second value. Likewise, increase the number by doubling the value if necessary. Example: Enter 20 for setting the backlash compensation. If this value is too weak for the compensation, increase the value to 40. If it generates too much compensation as a result, decrease to the value halfway between 20 and 40. If the value of 30 is still somewhat larger for the compensation, decrease to 25. On the contrary, if 30 is somewhat small, increase to 35. In this way you can adjust the mount for the most effective backlash compensation. Example: R.A = 10, DEC = 25 Setting the Backlash The values for the backlash compensation are available between "0" and "99" both in R.A and DEC Note: The "Backlash Compensation" has to be null if you use an autoguider. R.A = 0, DEC = 0 1In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "Backlash Compensation" with the or direction key and press the key to call up the dialog box. 2In the "Backlash Compensation" dialog box, move the cursor to entry spaces with the or direction key and enter your desired values with the or direction key. Pressing the key will shift the cursor to OK. Then press the again to save and leave the dialog box. Note: Using the or zoom key will increase or decrease by 10 within the range. 11 22 11 22 80 Chapter 5 APPLICATION GOTO Speed Polar Scope Light The setting is defaulted to „5". The setting is defaulted to „15". The maximum speed of automatic Go-To slewing can be chosen from the following 5 levels. 5 High : 800x (about 800 times of sidereal rate) 4 : 600x (about 600 times of sidereal rate) 3 : 400x (about 400 times of sidereal rate) 2 : 200x (about 200 times of sidereal rate) 1 Low : 100x (about 100 times of sidereal rate) Note: The speed is an approximation and it depends on loaded weight and condition of power source. 1In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "GOTO Speed" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) to call up the dialog box. 2In the "GOTO Speed" dialog box, choose your desired value with the or direction key. Press the ENTER key to save and leave the dialog box. 1In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "Polar Scope Light" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) to call up the dialog box. 2In the "Polar Scope Light Brightness" dialog box, choose your desired option with the or direction key and press the key. This allows adjustment of the brightness of the illuminator for the polar axis scope. While looking through the polar axis scope, adjust the brightness by number with the or direction key so that the reticle of the polar axis scope and Polaris (or 4 reference stars of Octans in the southern hemisphere) are visible at the same time in the field of view. 20 : The brightest : 0 : OFF the light Note: Using the or zoom key will increase or decrease by 10 within the range. 11 22 81 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Motor Power The setting is defaulted to „3" This allows for the changing electricity consumption of the mount as the need arises. When electricity consumption is set to "3", the mount will easily accomplish tracking and Go-To slewing of your telescope and equipment up to 10 kgs (22 lbs). The smaller the value is set, the lower the electricity consumption is used, but it may cause a failure in tracking or Go-To slewing due to a drop of the motor torques. Approximate values 4 High : 12V, 0.6A to 2.2A (7.2 watts to 26 watts) 3 : 12V, 0.55A to 2.0A (6.6 watts to 24 watts) 2 : 12V, 0.5A to 1.8A (6.0 watts to 22 watts) 1 Low : 12V, 0.45A to 1.7A (5.4 watts to 20 watts) About Failure of Tracking or Go-To Slewing If your telescope is not well-balanced or "Motor Power" is not set properly, the mount may not have torque enough to track or slew the telescope. If this happens, the STAR BOOK TEN will sound the alarm and the motors will stop momentarily. Then, the mount will restart the tracking and Go-To slewing automatically to reach the target. Tips on Using the Motor Power Menu If a total weight of the equipment installed on the mount is no more than 10 kgs (22 lbs) (excluding counterweights) and well-balanced, the default setting "3" would be sufficient enough to operate the mount stably. Chose the setting "4" if the loading weight exceeds 10 kgs (22 lbs), and choose the setting "2" or "1" if the loading weight is far less than 10 kgs (22 lbs) and you want to keep the electricity consumption as low as possible. An allowable payload of the mount is limited according to the size of your telescope regardless of its weight. Typically the larger the diameter of the telescope, the smaller the payload the mount accepts. Do not overly restrain the electricity consumption as it may result in failure of the motor controls Note *The wattages are based on the loading weight of 10 kgs (22 lbs) approximately. The electricity consumption is affected by the size of equipment mounted and the temperature. *Electricity consumption at the maximum loading weight of 15 kgs (33 lbs) would be about 0.6A to 2.5A (7.5 watts to 30 watts) at 12V. 1In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "Motor Power" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) to call up the dialog box. 2Choose your desired value by number with the or direction key. Press the key to enter and leave the dialog box. 11 22 82 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Mount Type The setting is defaulted to „Equatorial without Polar Setting" This allows choosing a mount type either "Equatorial with Polar Setting" or "Equatorial without Polar Setting". Equatorial without Polar Setting * Establishing star alignment in several points spread across the sky will make the GoTo slewing and tracking more accurate. * With the use of this option you can enjoy Go-To slewing easily without performing a polar alignment. * Since the mount is in motion without polar alignment, the tracking is done not only in the direction of R.A but also in the direction of DEC for correction. Choosing this option is not suitable for long exposure astro-photography. Equatorial with Polar Setting * Since the mount is polar aligned, even a few points of star alignment will make the Go-To slewing very accurate. Adding points of the star alignment will make the Go-To slewing perfect. * The tracking at sidereal rate is made only in the direction of R.A and the motion in the direction of DEC is cut out. Because of this, the accuracy of the tracking depends on how the mount has been aligned to the north (or south) celestial pole correctly. If the polar alignment is inaccurate, your telescope will shift in the direction of DEC during the tracking. Note: If the atmospheric reflection correction is in operation, it may affect the motion of R.A and DEC 1In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "Mount Type" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) to call up the dialog box. 2Choose your desired option the or direction key. Press the key to enter and leave the ★ ① ② ③ 11 22 83 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Cross Over Meridian CAUTION The settings are defaulted to the following The function of "Cross over Meridian" is a safety precaution to prevent the optical tube and equipped instruments from hitting the leg of the tripod. Wrong settings could cause scratches or damage to the optical tube and instruments, and could result in injuries. When using this function, be sure to check the configuration of each instrument installed. If your object of observation with the SXD2 mount is located on the east side of the meridian, the gravity of center of your telescope would be on the west side of the R.A axis of the mount. As the mount turns at sidereal rate tracking the object which moves toward the culmination, the optical tube approaches a place lower than the R.A axis of the mount. As a result, the optical tube may hit a leg of the tripod or the leg may interfere with instruments installed on the optical tube. To avoid this, the SXD2 mount has a safety function which makes the optical tube turn to the opposite position when the observing object comes to its culmination. However, this may be troublesome if you intend to do astro-imaging of celestial objects in the south side of the sky or photographing an object that is almost approaching to the culmination during the exposure. The function of "Cross Over Meridian" allows you to change a timing of the reverse motion of the optical tube. It is not possible to cancel the revised motion itself. East West Meridian Before Culmination Culmination After Culmination Warning for Telescope Reverse : Over 0 degrees Step 2 degrees Override Meridian Stop Point : Over 3 degrees GoTo (East Side) : Over 0 degrees 1In the "Mount Setting" menu, choose "Cross Over Meridian" with the or direction key and press the key (or the key) to call up the dialog box. 2In the "Cross Over Meridian" dialog box, choose your desired option the or direction key. 84 Chapter 5 APPLICATION Warning for Telescope Reverse Override Meridian Stop Point GoTo (East Side) This allows setting a point of the warning message to warn you against turning of the optical tube to the opposite position. The alarm sounds at the same time the warning message is indicated. The timing of the warning message can be designated by angle and it can be set to recall repeatedly with an interval of every one degree and more until the mount stops. Warning for Telescope Reverse Over : An angle to the west from the meridian as a point of warning for the telescope reverse. The setting value cannot exceed the angle to stop the mount forcedly.
