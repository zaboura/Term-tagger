SPECTRUM by Peter Tyson Time Travel TO AN ASTRONOMER INTENT ON measuring change, 100 years might as well be no time at all. Professionals and amateurs alike are used to evaluating variations that occur over millions or even billions of years. What's a century in the lifetime of a star or the parallax shift of a distant galaxy? Yet when it comes to the fi eld of astronomy, a century has brought truly radi-cal change, as Klaus Brasch chronicles in his article on page 58. You might liken the transformation to a blue supergiant before and after going supernova. To get my own sense of this — Brasch considers other examples — I looked at two books, one published in 1904 and the other in 2004. (I chose those years because my paternal grandfather was born in the fi rst and died in the second, and his lifetime serves as a handy yardstick for me when contemplating a cen-tury.) The fi rst book is Sir Robert Ball's A Popular Guide to the Heavens, images from which handsomely adorn the opening spread of Brasch's piece. The second is Astronomy: A Visual Guide, by Mark Garlick. Both offer a glimpse at the then-current state of astronomy for the interested layman. Skimming through Ball's book, certain lines jumped out at me: "Observers of Mars are divided into two camps — those who see the canals and those who do not." "The whole [of Messier 13] contains at least 5,000 stars . . ." "The light of the [Great Nebula in Andromeda] is such as would be given by vast numbers of stars crowded together [but] it is altogether premature to argue . . . that the nebula is really an enor-mous system of stars far away." Today, no one except perhaps a conspiracy theorist would posit artifi cial canals on Mars. We know that the globular cluster M13 has several hundred thousand stars. And the Great Nebula of Andromeda? That's indeed "an enormous system of stars far away" — the Andromeda Galaxy. Ball and his contemporaries knew of only a single galaxy, the Milky Way; today we count them in the billions. Flipping through Garlick's book elicits even more arresting realizations. The index alone lists terms that would have left Ball scratching his head. Active galactic nucleus. Big Bang. Black holes. Cosmic background radiation. Dark energy. Neutron stars. Pulsars. Radio astronomy. Supernovae. White dwarf. All of those subjects, studies of which drive much of modern astronomy, were entirely unknown in Ball's day. Before we begin feeling smug about how much more we know than Ball did, we need to ask ourselves the obvious question: What will astronomers know at the turn of the 22nd century that we haven't the slightest clue of today?

D U A N E D U N L A P & J A M M E Y C H U R C H FROM OUR READERS " Tidal Triggers In the News Note "Apollo-era Data Reveal the Moon's Tectonic Activity" (S&T: Aug. 2019, p. 8), Javier Barbuzano notes that six of the 28 detected moon-quakes occurred during lunar apogee, when the Moon is farthest from Earth. He explains, "The connection with apo-gee is important, because that's when Earth's tidal pull per lunar surface area is largest." I thought that the farther the Moon is from us, the weaker Earth's tidal pull (gravitational stress) should be — or am I mistaken? Michel Bonnement Courseulles sur Mer, France Kelly Beatty replies: Researcher Thomas Watters and his coauthors point out that the quakes result from a combination of global contraction, Earth-induced diurnal tides, and the Moon's orbital recession. The fault scarps they found are due to compression of the lunar crust, and (counterintuitively) the diurnal and recession stresses are most compressive near the tidal axis when the Moon is near apogee. Early this year a fellow member of the Smoky Mountain Astronomy Society (SMAS) and I rode to the top of Chil-howee Mountain in eastern Tennessee to take pictures of the elusive Omega Centauri. The summit overlooks Great Smoky Mountains National Park and has a very good view of the southern sky. Unfortunately, clouds lingered there for the whole night, and we had to pick another target. The Hercules cluster, M13, was rising in the east and in perfect position for photography. Three hours and 20 minutes later, I had accu-mulated a hundred 2-minute exposures, and Jammey Church processed them. We created a beautiful picture with brilliant colors, but the story doesn't end there. We proudly showed the results to other SMAS members, with one taking an acute interest. Michael McCullough Over the Limit Don Ferguson states that both his 3.5-inch and 7-inch Questar telescopes exceed the resolving power predicted by Dawes' equation (S&T: June 2019, p. 36). For example, while the Dawes limit is 1.3 for a 3.5-inch scope, Ferguson's achieves 1 . He gets similar results with the 7-inch. Part of this is likely due to the high quality of modern optical components, compared to what Dawes was working with in the 1860s, but I've always suspected that Dawes was being a bit conservative, too. (Interestingly, Questar claims a 1 resolution for the 3.5-inch in its spec sheet.) This leads me to wonder whether a 3.5-inch refractor would get even better results. The 89-mm Questar scope is a Maksutov with a central obstruction of 27.9 mm, giving it an effective aperture of just 84.5 mm. Would a good apochro-matic refractor of this aperture achieve the same results as Ferguson's Questar? Either way, I'm jealous of him for own-ing two of these marvelous telescopes! Tom Sales Somerset, New Jersey I have owned fi ve 3½-inch Questars since 1966, and on the night of August 7, 1966, I elongated Gamma2 (γ2) Andromedae at 160× and 200× with one of those scopes when the seeing was virtually perfect. According to the 13th edition of Norton's Star Atlas, γ2 Andromedae's 5.4- and 6.6-magnitude components have an orbital period of 55 years and were at their widest sepa-ration in 1971. Based on this and my visual observa-tions of other doubles, I concluded the telescope's resolution was around 3.5″/a (with a the aperture in inches) — the same as Ferguson found many years later, rather than the Dawes value of 4.56″/a. The ability of the Questar's optics to resolve below the Dawes limit is readily explained. As pointed out by Henry E. Paul in his 1965 classic Telescopes for Skygazing, the presence of a central obstruction decreases the size of the Airy disk of a diffracted point source. Current Questar literature states this obstruction is 32.5% of the aperture's diameter. This results in a decrease in Membership Has Its Privileges p Messier 13, the majestic globular cluster in Hercules, shares the fi eld with many fainter deep-sky companions — such as the 12th-magnitude galaxy NGC 6207 at upper left. North is up. 6 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE was more interested in the objects cap-tured in the background. After studying the uncropped original (https://is.gd/ Dunlap_M13), he discovered more than 20 galaxies surrounding the cluster. Researching the subject further, we came across Bob King's "M13 with a Side of Galaxies, Please" on the S&T website (https://is.gd/M13_galaxies), which helped greatly, but the story doesn't end there either. McCullough turned to the SIMBAD database to identify additional galaxies. Then he used redshift values to deter-mine their corresponding distances in light-years and an online estimator to get the light-travel time, assuming a fl at universe. One of the galaxies captured in our image is more than 2 billion light-years away! This experience shows the value of being in an astronomy club and reading Sky & Telescope. Duane Dunlap • Knoxville, Tennessee º December 1944 Galaxy Centers Resolved "One of the observational problems that most astronomers expected could be solved only with the new 200-inch telescope has been success-fully tackled with the Mount Wilson 100-inch by Dr. [Walter] Baade. Making long exposures on red-sen-sitive photographic plates, he has [resolved] into stars the nebulous nucleus of the Andromeda galaxy and its two companions, Messier 32 and NGC 205. The Griffi th Observer attributes this success to the Los Angeles–Pasadena dimout, which allowed longer exposure times than were previously possible." The term "dimout" refers to the nighttime use of blackout curtains in homes and restrictions on out-door lighting during World War II. º December 1969 Messier's Mistake "It can be simply demonstrated that the lost Messier object M91 is very prob-ably the galaxy NGC 4548 . . . M91 was the last of a group of eight neb-ulae observed by Charles Messier on the night of March 18, 1781. The French astronomer described it as a 'nebula without stars' and fainter than M90. . . . "My solution of the puzzle assumes that Messier determined the position of NGC 4548 by measuring its right ascension and declination relative to those of the nearby galaxy M89 (since there is no suitable reference star in the vicinity) . . . It is further assumed that, in calculating the coordinates of the new object, by mistake he applied the observed differences to the coordinates of M58, a 9th-mag-nitude galaxy Messier had recorded two years earlier. . . . [This switch] reproduces the [erroneous] Messier position to 0m.1 in right ascension and 1′ in declination. . . . "Since NGC 4548 is probably the long-lost M91, as a Messier Club member I would be pleased to see this fi ne spiral galaxy returned to the Messier catalogue." This reasoning by amateur Wil-liam C. Williams is now generally accepted; M91 is missing no more. º December 1994 Bigger, Biggest "What kind of large-scale structure exists in the universe? Are galaxies really arrayed in great sheets wrapped around giant voids? . . . In an attempt to answer these challeng-ing questions, a team of French astronomers led by Georges Paturel (Lyon Observatory) has mapped more than 24,000 galaxies . . . "When . . . each galaxy is plot-ted in three dimensions, a striking pattern emerges. A giant shell of galaxies stretches more than 650 million light-years [in extent], roughly centered on the Local Supercluster of which the Milky Way is a part. . . . It is currently the largest known structure in the uni-verse, incorporating the 'Great Wall' of galaxies discovered in 1989 . . ." We now know about arrange-ments of remote quasars stretching across several billion light-years. 1944 1969 1994 75, 50 & 25 YEARS AGO by Roger W. Sinnott size of the Airy disk by about 9%, so you get a 9% improvement in resolution. Also, it's well known that blue stars can be resolved at closer separations than red or yellow stars can, and γ2 Andromedae's stars are intensely blue in color. J. B. Sidgwick also wrote that some visual observers put central obstructions on their refractors to get better resolving power on some doubles. For example, S. W. Burnham detected some equal or nearly equal doubles separated by just 0.2″ with his 6-inch Alvan Clark refrac-tor — a feat that was diffi cult to equal even with the 36-inch Lick refractor! Scattered throughout the astro-nomical literature are many examples of resolution below the Dawes limit. Sometimes resolution and detection are confused, but Ferguson has done an excellent job of getting rid of any confu-sion between them. Rodger W.

That means the distance from its center to its event horizon is more than four times the distance from the Sun to Neptune. Is that right?! James Folsom Portola Valley, California Camille Carlisle replies: That's correct! Using the calculated mass of 6.5 billion Suns, M87* would have a Schwarzschild radius of 128 astronomical units — compared to Neptune's semimajor axis of 30 a.u. But this calculation assumes it's a non-spinning black hole. If M87* spins, it will drag spacetime closer around it and effectively shrink the event horizon's size. Since all the supermassive black holes that we've measured spins for generally have rapid rotations, it's likely that the event horizon for M87* is somewhat smaller than 128 a.u.

Now, astronomers are using this century of observations to understand the star's recent change in behavior. For the fi rst few decades, the star's brightness went up and down by about 4½ to 5 magnitudes over the course of some 300 days. But over the past 20 years, this pattern changed to a more rapid cycle: The star now brightens and fades by only 1½ to 2 magnitudes over a period of roughly 200 days. Astrono-mers noting this change have proposed that the star is undergoing a rare and (from a stellar perspective) short-lived change in structure. Now, László Molnár (Konkoly Obser-vatory, Hungary) and colleagues have used the amateur observations as input to state-of-the-art computer simula-tions to understand the star's inner structure as it goes through this change. The results appear in the July 1st Astro-physical Journal. T UMi is a red giant whose inert carbon-oxygen core is not under enough pressure to ignite fusion. Instead, the star fuses hydrogen in a shell around the core, eventually stockpiling enough helium for it to ignite. In the picture that has emerged, such a fl ash briefl y expanded the inner regions of the star so much that it temporarily extin-guished the hydrogen-burning shell and shrank the outer layers. The star as a whole dimmed and contracted. The smaller radius meant that the pulsa-tions shrank, too. This helium fl ash is the reason behind the star's sudden change in behavior two decades ago. As the star contracted, a second pulsation mode appeared in the star. While the fundamental period of the star's brightness changes is now 198 days, there's an "overtone" of varia-tions that occur on a 111-day timescale. AAVSO observations were crucial to seeing this overtone, and the overtone is in turn crucial to understanding the star's interior. Using their model of the star's inter-nal structure, Molnár and colleagues deduce that T UMi is twice the Sun's mass, about 300 times its diameter, and 1.2 billion years old. The model also predicts that the star's recent contrac-tion, and the subsequent decrease of its pulsation period, will last another 50 years. Then the star should begin to expand and brighten again. The star's ultimate fate — collapsing to a white dwarf several hundred thousand years from now — is beyond human lifetimes. But amateur observers, or perhaps their children, will be able to watch the end of this brief phase of stellar evolution. ■ MONICA YOUNG STARS A Century of Amateur Observations Sheds Light on Stellar Evolution SOLAR SYSTEM Impact Flash on Jupiter WHEN TEXAS AMATEUR Ethan Chap-pel looked up at the sky for Perseid meteors on the night of Tuesday, August 6th, he didn't know that his Celestron 8-inch EdgeHD telescope was captur-ing the possible impact of a much larger "meteor" at Jupiter. After running his camera data through software called DeTeCt, which alerts the user to transient events, Chappel spotted a fl ash of light just inside the southern edge of the planet's South Equatorial Belt (SEB), west of the Great Red Spot. The pinpoint of light expanded slightly before fading away — telltale signs of a possible impact based p Light variations of T UMi show that the star's pulsation period (purple to red) has been decreas-ing since the 1980s. In 2000, the shape of the brightness variations began changing as well. 10 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE V is u a l b ri g h tn e s s ( m a g n it u d e ) 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 14 12 10 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 Year 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 14 12 10 8 14 12 10 8 8 t A processed color image shows the fl ash in the South Equatorial Belt, which appeared at 4:07.5 UT on August 7, 2019. IN BRIEF India's Lander Crashes on the Moon India's attempt to land on the Moon ended when mission control lost contact with the Vikram lander, part of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, moments before touchdown. It was a disappointing fi nish to a six-week journey. After launch, a series of orbital boosts gradu-ally raised the mission's elliptical orbit around Earth, until it was captured by the Moon's gravity on August 20th. Vikram separated from the orbiter on September 2nd for a four-day descent that took it 100 kilometers (62 miles) down to the lunar surface. Contact was lost at just 2 km above the surface; the lander appears to have landed in one piece but efforts to restore communication have failed. Vikram landed near its target, on a plain near the lunar south pole. It would have deployed a small rover, named Pragyan, to search for water ice trapped near the poles. Neverthe-less, the Chandrayaan 2 mission overall has achieved 90% of its objectives. The orbiter remains fully functional and will continue to map the Moon's surface and monitor the lunar environment over the coming year. ■ DAVID DICKINSON Final Four Asteroid Sites Selected NASA has narrowed down Osiris-REX's po-tential landing sites on asteroid 101955 Ben-nu to four possible locations. The spacecraft will touch down on the surface next year to collect some 60 grams of regolith. The site selection comes after Osiris-REX surveyed the jumbled surface of the ½-kilometer (0.3-mile) wide rock. NASA had hoped to have the sites narrowed down to two by now, but for-tunately, the mission timeline allows an extra 300 days for site assessment. The four sites are named after birds native to Egypt: • Nightingale is located the farthest north. The area shows characteristics of dark, fi ne-grain material suitable for collection. • Kingfi sher is located near the asteroid's equatorial region. A spectrum of the site shows the strongest signature of hydrated material of the four sites. • Osprey is also located in the equatorial region and appears to have a diverse array of rock types. It also shows the strongest signs of carbon-rich material. • Sandpiper is the farthest south of the four sites and also contains hydrated minerals. The team will announce the two fi nal sites — a primary and a backup — in December. ■ DAVID DICKINSONNA S A / J P L -C A L T E C H s k ya nd te l e scope .com • D EC E M B E R 2 019 11 on previous events observed at Jupiter. The fl ash captured on Chappel's video lasts around 1.5 seconds. Unlike with some previous Jupi-ter strikes, amateurs haven't spotted any dark impact scars in the wake of this one. Heidi Hammel (Space Sci-ence Institute) noted that this event was consistent with an impactor on the order of 10 meters wide and was therefore unlikely to leave dark debris. If confi rmed, this would be the 7th recorded impact at the solar system's biggest planet since July 1994, when 21 fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 slammed into the planet and created a rosary of dark impact boils visible in amateur telescopes. Additional crashes by either asteroids or comets were observed in 2009, 2010 (two events), 2012, 2016, and 2017. ■ BOB KING ASTRONOMERS MAY BE WITNESS-ING the slow and steady inspiral of the planet WASP-12b into its star, Joshua Winn (Princeton University) reported at the Extreme Solar Systems IV con-ference in Reykjavik, Iceland. The planet is a puffed-up gas giant that transits its star every 1.1 days from a distance of just 0.02 astro-nomical unit (a.u.). Astronomers had previously noticed that the time inter-vals between its successive transits had decreased by 29 milliseconds a year, adding up to an overall decrease of 0.3 second since the planet's discovery in 2008. Fred Rasio (Northwestern Univer-sity) and colleagues predicted back in 1996 that hot Jupiter orbits might decay due to tidal interactions with their parent stars. But that decay ought to happen very slowly, at least initially. The rapid change in WASP-12b's orbital period implies that we happen to be observing the planet close to the end of its inspiral. An alternative is that the planet's orbit might be slightly elliptical. Its orientation would then change over time (an effect known as apsidal precession), producing a gradual shift in transit times. But this explanation faces challenges, too, as tidal forces ought to have circularized WASP-12b's orbit by now. Astronomers used the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe WASP-12b's transits as well as its occultations. In the case of apsidal precession, the true orbital period doesn't change — if transits occur earlier than expected, occultations would occur later. But in the case of orbital decay, the exact times of transits and occultations would shift in the same direction. The Spitzer observations support the latter case, Winn says. According to David Latham (Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smith-sonian), the evidence that WASP-12b is going into a death spiral is "quite convincing." But, he adds, "I think it is too early to conclude that apsidal precession is excluded." The new results fi t with earlier observations showing that WASP-12b is losing its atmosphere at some ten-millionths of a Jupiter mass per year. Apparently, the planet's demise has already begun. ■ GOVERT SCHILLING p An artist's concept shows a hot Jupiter similar to WASP-12b. EXOPLANETS Hot Jupiter on the Verge of Falling into Its Star NEWS NOTES 12 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE NO MOON HAS BEEN CONFIRMED around any of the thousands of exo-planets discovered to date. But Ceci-lia Lazzoni (University of Padova, Italy) reported at the Extreme Solar Systems IV conference in Reykjavik, Iceland, that her team might have found two giant exomoons orbiting two low-mass brown dwarfs. The astronomers analyzed a three-year span of data from the Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE) instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile of substellar companions around two parent stars. Both companions appear to be low-mass brown dwarfs. Around each of these objects, further analysis of the images by Lazzoni's team turned up a faint can-didate moon. But it's unclear whether these can-didates should really be classifi ed as "moons." Lazzoni said that the candi-dates are so large that the planet-moon pairs could alternatively be described as binary planets. The fi rst brown dwarf orbits its red dwarf parent star at a distance of at least 300 astronomical units (a.u.) — some 10 times the distance between the Sun and Neptune. The brown dwarf's "moon" appears to be just less mas-sive than Jupiter, based on its infrared brightness, and orbits its host at a distance of 10 a.u. The second brown dwarf orbits more than 270 a.u. from its Sun-like star, and it has a moon 4.6 times Jupiter's mass that orbits at a distance of 8 a.u. The team is still collecting additional observations on these objects in prepa-ration for publication and so hasn't yet revealed the host stars' identities. The potential discoveries could shed light on the formation of brown dwarfs around stars. If the planet-size moons are indeed on such wide orbits, then the brown dwarfs might have come together more like stars than like planets — born via gravitational instabilities in the sam e cloud of gas and dust from which the central star formed. Eric Nielsen (Stanford University), who wasn't involved in the study, says he's "intrigued" by the result. But, he adds, "these are extremely diffi cult techniques, so we really need indepen-dent confi rmation." ■ GOVERT SCHILLING EXOPLANETS Have Astronomers Detected Exomoons At Last? p A 2018 image shows the supernova 54,000 light-years from its dwarf galaxy host. STARS The Supernova That Destroyed Its Star THE FIRST STARS in the early uni-verse may have ended their lives in total annihilation. Sebastian Gomez (Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian) and colleagues think they've caught a bona fi de example of such a stellar detonation, designated SN 2016iet. They report the results in the August 20th Astrophysical Journal. When a typical massive star runs out of fuel, its core collapses into something that's stable against gravity's pull — either a neutron star or a black hole. But when a star has an initial mass of at least 100 Suns, the core heats up to such a degree that it begins to form electrons and their antimatter partners, positrons. Electron-positron pairs don't push against gravity, so the star keeps collapsing, igniting runaway fusion. The entire star detonates before it has the chance to transform into a black hole. Astronomers call this event a pair-instability supernova. But while a few candidates have been observed, none have provided enough information to confi rm the scenario. SN 2016iet is different. Automated systems and observatories, including a data-processing pipeline that looks for transients in data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, pro-vided initial images of the supernova. Astronomers have also followed it for years using ground-based telescopes. Initial observations showed that the supernova was isolated, occurring an incredible 54,000 light-years from its dwarf galaxy host. A spectrum showed no hydrogen, leading researchers to classify the blast as a Type I super-nova. But the object's properties don't resemble any other known supernovae. The astronomers tested various scenarios against the light curve of the supernova's fading brightness. Based on the results, the team concluded that before it exploded, the star had between 55 and 120 Suns' worth of mass. It existed in a relatively pristine environ-ment that hadn't changed much since the Big Bang. In other words, in both its mass and environment, the star was similar to the universe's fi rst stars — and had the right properties to be a pair-instability supernova. ■ MONICA YOUNG G O M E Z E T A L . 2 0 1 9 / A S T R O P H Y S IC A L J O U R N A L , A U G U S T 2 0 , 2 0 1 9 Host galaxy SN 2016iet 54,000 light-years YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER FRAME www.QSImaging.com QSI are proud to announce a new large format camera, the QSI-6162.

NEWS NOTES 14 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE MILKY WAY Untangling Stellar Strings ASTRONOMERS HAVE IDENTIFIED thousands of new groupings of stars within 3,000 light-years of the Sun, and hundreds of them appear to be surpris-ingly string-like in shape. These stellar threads may trace the evolution of the Milky Ways' spiral arms, Marina Koun-kel (Western Washington University) and colleagues explain in the September issue of the Astronomical Journal. Kounkel and colleagues started with almost 20 million stars for which the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite had measured distances, positions on the sky, and velocities toward or away from Earth. Using a type of machine learning (S&T: Dec. 2017, p. 20), the researchers sorted through the immense amount of data to determine whether and how stars are clustered. While less than 1.5% of the 20 mil-lion stars belong to a group, of those stars that do move through space together, roughly half belong to long, string-shaped groups. The other half divide themselves among more than 1,300 smaller, more spherical groups. p As a group the youngest strings (less than 100 million years old, shown here) follow the Local Arm of the Milky Way, which runs along the vertical line that crosses this plot. However, individual strings line up perpendicular to this arm. The Sun is located at the center. p This image comes from the Yutu 2 rover as it looked back over its tracks across the lunar surface. As it drives, instruments aboard Yutu 2 investigate the regolith for clues to the Moon's past. The stellar strings are on average 30 light-years across and 650 light-years long, which falls into the typical size and shape range of star-forming clouds. Kounkel says it's likely that a single cloud would make a single string. The astronomers determined the strings' ages to explore their evolution, fi nding that the structures are surpris-ingly long-lived. "We generally thought young stars would leave their birth sites just a few million years after they form," Kounkel explains. "But it seems that stars can stay close to their siblings for as long as a few billion years." At the same time, the strings appear to trace something ephemeral: The Milky Way's spiral arms. The youngest strings — those younger than 100 mil-lion years old — together form a narrow structure that follows along the Local Arm, the spiral arm that houses the Sun (S&T: Nov. 2019, p. 16). The strings themselves lie perpendicular to the arm. Older strings appear to align in ways that don't relate to the Local Arm, but the team argues they might mark other spiral arms that have since dissipated. Coauthor Kevin Covey (also at Western Washington University) notes, "Older strings are an important 'fossil record' of our galaxy's spiral structure." ■ MONICA YOUNG • Explore an interactive 3D version of the map at https://is.gd/stellarstrings. 1,600 light-years Sun To galactic center On the Farside: Chang'e 4 Update China's Chang'e 4 mission has completed its ninth lunar day on the farside of the Moon, during which the Yutu 2 rover has driven 284.7 meters (933.9 feet). The mission is due to enter its 10th lunar day exploring Von Kármán Crater in the South Pole-Aitken impact basin on September 22nd. First results came in the May 16th Nature, in which mission scientists reported in situ observations of materi-als that might have originated from below the Moon's crust. Addi-tional results are forthcoming from radar measurements of the lunar subsurface. Meanwhile, the Queqiao relay satellite, which facilitates communications between Chang'e 4 and Earth, will soon be starting a science experiment of its own. It carries the Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer (NCLE), a pathfi nder experiment for low-frequency radio astronomy. In the coming months, NCLE will begin observations between 80 kHz and 80 MHz. (Frequencies below 30 MHz are only accessible from space.) Finally, a tiny, 47-kilogram (100-lb) satellite that launched with Queqiao ended its mission on July 31st by crash-ing into the Moon.

Even as men set foot on the Moon and spacecraft sped past Venus and Mars, the outermost worlds seemed to yield their secrets as slowly as they revolve around the Sun: Uranus, twice as remote as the Ringed Planet, completing an orbit once every 84 years; Neptune, a billion miles beyond, taking a leisurely 165 years to do the same; and Pluto, nearly a billion miles beyond that, its year 248 times longer than our own. Today, planetary scientists marvel at exquisite images from our recent trip to Pluto, but its two giant neighbors still lan-guish. Uranus and Neptune have entertained only one pass-ing spacecraft, Voyager 2, back in 1986 and 1989, respectively. Since then, we've relied on the Hubble Space Telescope and adaptive optics on large ground-based telescopes, which now let astronomers scrutinize Uranus and Neptune from afar. "We have learned an incredible amount since Voyager," says Imke de Pater (University of California, Berkeley), who tracks storms on Uranus and Neptune by using Hubble and the Keck Observatory in Hawai'i. Other observers have spot-ted new rings and moons. But David Stevenson (Caltech), who is more interested in the planets' interiors than their atmospheres, sees things differently. "We've learned remarkably little about Uranus and Neptune since the Voyager encounters," he says. We still don't know what substance constitutes the bulk of each planet, he adds, nor do we know whether the planets are layered like Earth, with a core, mantle, and envelope. Planetary scientists do agree on one thing, though: "We're all eager to go back," says William McKinnon (Washington University). Twin Planets With similar colors, diameters, masses, densities, and rota-tion rates, Uranus and Neptune are twin worlds. Even their discoveries were intertwined. Irregularities in the motion of Uranus around the Sun stemmed from Neptune's gravita-tional pull, leading to the more distant planet's discovery. Both planets owe their distinct colors — Uranus is green or aqua, Neptune blue — to methane gas. Their atmospheres consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, but 3% or 4% of the air is methane. This molecule absorbs red light but refl ects green and blue. No one knows, however, why the planets differ slightly in hue. Perhaps Neptune's air has more methane, causing a deeper blue. Perhaps haze subdues the color on Uranus. Or perhaps Neptune has tiny particles that enhance its color via Rayleigh scattering, the same phenomenon that causes the blue sky on Earth. All four giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Nep-tune — have about the same amount of ice, rock, and metal, roughly 10 to 20 Earth masses, at their centers. A hydrogen-The q FORLORN Voyager 2 took these parting shots of the crescents of Uranus (left) and Neptune during its fl ybys in the 1980s. No spacecraft has visited since. Decades after a lone spacecraft fl ew by, the solar system's ice giants and their many moons still guard plenty of secrets.

Yet this similarity points to a great difference. For Uranus and Neptune, the hydrogen-helium envelope accounts for just a small fraction of each planet's mass. Jupiter and Saturn, on the other hand, are mostly hydrogen and helium. When Jupiter and Saturn were forming, they must have grabbed lots of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk around the newborn Sun, whereas Uranus and Neptune took just a little. "You might think of Uranus and Neptune as being naked Jupiter and Saturn," Stevenson says. McKinnon adds, "They're baby giant planets that didn't get to grow up." Indeed, each of these "baby giants" is only 5% as massive as Jupiter and, at four times Earth's diameter, about a third as wide. Because hydrogen and helium are gases on Earth, planetary scientists call Jupiter and Saturn gas giants, but their great gravity actually squeezes most of these gases into a fl uid. In contrast, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, so named because they have large quantities of three compounds that were frozen solid in the cold outer solar nebula: water (H2O), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3), in unknown proportions. Because oxygen is more common in the cosmos than carbon and nitrogen, the main component in both planets may be water. And despite the term "ice giant," this water is mostly liquid, because the interiors are so hot. At the greatest depths, however, intense pressure may squeeze the water into superionic ice, which Burkhard Mil-itzer (University of California, Berkeley) compares to a soft solid, like chalk. "It's neither completely solid nor completely liquid," he says. In superionic water, the oxygen atoms are locked into place but the smaller hydrogen nuclei move like people walking through a parking lot full of sta-tionary cars, he explains. Hydrogen nuclei are protons, and a current of protons through each planet's mantle may explain one of Voyager's strangest fi ndings: Both planets have tilted magnetic fi elds that arise far from the planets' centers. In contrast, Earth's magnetic fi eld comes from the fl ow of elec-trons through molten iron in our planet's outer core. Uranus and Neptune probably have more "ice" — that is, water, methane, and ammonia — than rock and metal com-bined, but Stevenson says this is not known with certainty. t Top: Voyager 2 caught these linear clouds on Neptune, where they stretched approximately along lines of constant latitude.

If they are, each planet may have a rock-iron core, a water-methane-ammonia mantle, and a hydrogen-helium envelope. But it's also possible that the various substances mix together so that no sharp boundaries exist. Clues from Clouds Despite their different distances from the Sun, Uranus and Neptune have the same effective temperature of 59 Kelvin (−353° Fahrenheit). This similarity actually betrays a key dif-ference: Uranus radiates no more heat than it receives from the Sun, whereas Neptune emits more than twice as much, presumably leftover heat from its birth. Jupiter and Saturn also give off more heat than they receive. No one knows why Uranus is unique. Perhaps it lost its heat of formation soon after birth, or, conversely, perhaps its interior is so stratifi ed that the heat can't escape. The unexplained contrast in heat fl ow does explain another difference between the two ice giants: "Neptune is a lot more dynamic than Uranus," de Pater says. Voyager showed Uranus to be so bland that the planet made news when astronomers later detected clouds and storms there. In contrast, Nep-tune has plenty of both, thanks to its vigorous internal heat. Although the planet's best-known storm, the Great Dark Spot that Voyager 2 saw, has vanished, similar storms have erupted since. Fast winds race across both planets. High white clouds often fringe the dark storms and prob-ably consist of methane ice. These clouds resemble orographic clouds on Earth, where air rises over mountains and cools, causing water vapor to condense and form clouds. Likewise, methane-laden air on Uranus and Neptune rises over the storms and condenses, creating the high white clouds. Below lies the main cloud deck. In 2018 Patrick Irwin (University of Oxford, UK) and his colleagues reported the infrared signature of hydrogen sulfi de, a poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs. This work confi rmed earlier sugges-tions indicating that the main cloud deck consists of hydrogen sulfi de ice. Why hydrogen sulfi de? Beneath the hydrogen sulfi de clouds, ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfi de (H2S) join to form yet another compound, ammonium hydrosul-fi de (NH4SH). Because each molecule has one atom of nitrogen and one of sulfur, whichever element is less abundant gets used up, leaving the other to form a gas. An overabundance of sulfur explains the hydro-gen sulfi de in the air above. The discovery means Uranus and Neptune have more sulfur than nitrogen. That makes them unlike Jupiter and Saturn and unlike the overall galaxy, which has nearly fi ve times as much nitrogen as sulfur. "This observation is quite important," de Pater says.

If instead nitrogen were more com-mon in the atmosphere, ammonia clouds would form, as they do on Jupi-ter and Saturn. Perhaps, at the greater distance and colder temperatures of Uranus and Neptune, water ice in the planetesimals that built the two worlds trapped more sulfur-bearing gases than nitrogen-bearing ones. Far below all these clouds, tempera-tures become warmer, and scientists expect good old-fashioned water clouds to exist. But no one has yet seen them. Rings and Things Both Uranus and Neptune spin fast but have very different axial tilts. Voy-ager found that Uranus spins every 17 hours or so and Neptune about every 16 hours — faster than Earth but more slowly than Jupiter and Saturn. These fi gures constrain models of planetary inte-riors; however, with only one spacecraft measurement, some scientists have questioned the numbers. Although Uranus and Neptune have similar spin peri-ods, their rotation axes are another story. Early in Uranus's life, an object roughly twice as massive as Earth might have slammed into the planet, knocking it over. Or that object may have whizzed by the planet, twirling it around via grav-ity. Either way, Uranus now lies on its side as it spins, with an axial tilt of 98°. In contrast, Neptune's axis tilts only 28°, similar to Earth's. Both Uranus and Neptune have rings, though they're much darker than those around Saturn. Astronomers fi rst detected Uranus's rings in 1977, when the planet passed in front of a star and 5 narrow rings blocked the star's light before and after the planet did. Subsequent discoveries have boosted the total number of known rings to 13. Because of its drastic axial tilt, Uranus points one pole almost directly sunward during summer and winter solstices, giving observ-ers on Earth a face-on view of the rings, fi rst from the top, then decades later from the bottom. Neptune has six rings. Ground-based astrono-mers saw hints of one in the 1980s (S&T: June 1989, p. 606), but Voyager defi nitively discovered fi ve. A sixth ring, which may not fully wrap around the planet, also appears among the others in the Voyager data. In addition, the spacecraft saw enhancements of material in four sections of the outer-most ring. How these ring arcs arose is unknown, but they may owe their existence to gravitational resonances with various satellites or to collisions in the ring. Since Voyager's visit, two of the four ring arcs have disappeared; perhaps new ring arcs will form in the future. Whereas Saturn's stunning rings glisten with water ice, those of Uranus and Neptune are dark, probably due to carbon compounds. Small moons tug on the rings and actually spawn others. For example, the moons Cordelia and Ophelia orbit Uranus on either side of its brightest ring, named Epsilon, their grav-ity keeping that ring narrow, while Neptune's moon Galatea probably sprinkles material along its orbit and creates the diffuse ring it inhabits. It's a Mab Mab World Indeed, both planets have lots of moons. When Voyager fl ew past, it tripled the number known at Uranus from 5 to 15 and quadrupled the number known at Neptune from 2 to 8. This created the pleasing coincidence that the eighth planet from the Sun had eight known moons. But Hubble and ground-based telescopes have nearly doubled the numbers again. Today, Uranus has 27 known moons and Neptune 14. On its visit to Uranus, Voyager passed closest to Miranda, the smallest and innermost of the fi ve classical Uranian moons, and astonished scientists with pictures of radically different terrain types, some ancient, others young. "It's a kind of schizophrenic world," McKinnon says. Thirteen additional moons, most found by Voyager, lie inside Miranda's orbit. All are smaller than Miranda. One of the most intriguing is Mab, which Mark Showalter (SETI Institute) and Jack Lissauer (NASA Ames) found in 2003. Mab lies in the outermost ring, named Mu. In like fashion, the moon Enceladus, which orbits Saturn and is about the size of Miranda, lies in that planet's E ring. The E ring comes from geysers on Enceladus that spew water along its orbit. Both rings are blue, so Mab might be doing something similar around Uranus. But there's a problem. "Mab is tiny," Showalter says. It's much smaller than Enceladus. How can a moon that's roughly a dozen miles across be geologically active? No one tMIRANDA This 1986 image from Voyager 2 shows the varied terrain on Uranus's icy moon Miranda. Features that look like compressional folded ridges mix with faults, and some of the scarps are up to 5 km high — higher than the walls of the Grand Canyon.

But dusty rings are reddish, not blue. The puzzle therefore remains. Nine of Uranus's inner moons constitute the most tightly packed satellite system ever seen. Planetary scientists have long recognized that the moons are in danger, as gravitational tugs among the moons may make them swerve into the wrong lane. In 2017, Robert Chancia (University of Idaho) and his colleagues measured the mass of a small inner moon named Cressida based on how its gravity distorts Uranus's Eta Ring. Knowing the mass, the scientists then predicted that the moon might crash into its neighbor, Desdemona, in just a million years. The debris from that collision should encircle the planet in a new ring. All the moons near Uranus — the 13 innermost moons plus the 5 satellites known prior to Voyager — are so-called regular satellites, because they follow fairly circular orbits close to the planet's equatorial plane. In contrast, at much greater distances lie 9 additional moons, all found since Voyager, on elliptical and inclined orbits. These "irregular" satellites did not form with Uranus but instead were captured by it. All but one of the irregular satellites orbit the planet backward, opposite the direction it spins. Retrograde irregular moons outnumber prograde ones because the Sun's gravity can't as easily yank a retrograde moon away from its planet. Far-Out Moons At Neptune, the standout moon is Triton. It is nearly twice as large as Uranus's largest moon and slightly larger than Pluto. Yet Triton revolves backward, a sign that it, too, is a captured world, one that once roamed through space on its own as TRITON LARISSA GALATEA DESPINA THALASSA NAIAD TRITON NEREID NEREID LAOMEDEIA PS AM AT HE SAO H A LIM ED E HIPPOCAMP NE SO PROTEUS t THE NEPTUNE SYSTEM Neptune has 14 known moons and six rings (blue, four combined here due to scale).

Triton is the largest retrograde moon in the solar system. Its arrival doomed most of Nep-tune's other moons. Triton probably smacked into some, tossed others into the planet, and ejected still others altogether. One moon that managed to hang on was Nereid, but its orbit became stretched out due to the new-comer's gravity. Nereid now has the most elliptical orbit of any moon in the solar system, with an orbital eccentric-ity of a whopping 75%. Triton suffered, too. Its initial orbit around Neptune was elongated, but Neptune's tides forced its path to become circular, internally scorch-ing the moon and melting all its ice and maybe even its rock. Volcanic eruptions must have spewed out lots of gas, wrapping the moon in a thick atmosphere. Today, Triton's atmosphere resembles Pluto's, tenuous and full of nitrogen. Geysers send additional gas into the air. Triton is about as close to Neptune as the Moon is to Earth. Inside Triton's orbit lie seven other satellites, all on cir-cular paths, all but one found by Voyager. The largest, and the second largest orbiting Neptune, is Proteus. Voyager images revealed a battered world with a huge crater named Pharos. The crater might be a scar from an impact that created the small moon Hippocamp, which Showalter spotted in 2013 in an orbit that lies near Proteus. Beyond the orbits of Triton and Nereid, fi ve other irregular satellites pursue elliptical and inclined orbits around Nep-tune. The most distant, Neso, ventures farther from its planet than does any other moon in the solar system. At its extreme, Neso skirts 72 million kilometers from its master — nearly half the distance between the Sun and Earth. So distant is Neso that it takes 26 years to orbit Neptune once, nearly as long as Saturn takes to circle the Sun. Yet Neptune can retain this remote retrograde moon because the planet itself is so far from the Sun's gravity. In 2003 Scott Sheppard (Carnegie Institution for Science) and his team discovered Psamathe, a retrograde moon whose orbit overlaps Neso's. He speculates that the two moons might once have been a single object that split apart when a large comet hit it. "Almost all these moons are just points of light" through a telescope, he adds. "So we really don't know much about them." Return to the Ice Giants? All these moons and the planets they orbit provide rich targets for future spacecraft. An orbiter like the ones Jupiter and Saturn have received would scrutinize these systems for years. To reach the planets quickly, a spacecraft must swing by Jupiter, whose gravity would fl ing the craft outward. The next launch opportunities to Uranus and Neptune occur around 2030, lead-ing to encounters around 2040. No such missions are yet funded, but planetary scientists in both the United States and Europe are draw-ing up plans. After all, every planet from Mercury to Saturn has received at least one orbiting spacecraft, and we now know that planets the size of Uranus and Neptune abound throughout the galaxy (S&T: Sept. 2019, p. 16). Orbiters to the two nearest examples would divine clues to their interiors, compositions, and atmospheres. Moreover, such spacecraft would fl y past moon after fascinating moon and could discover additional satellites as well. Uranus in particular presents a timely opportunity. By bad luck, Voyager fl ew past when one of the planet's poles pointed nearly sunward, which meant that, even as Uranus and its regular satellites turned, one side of each world stayed hidden in darkness. In contrast, sunlight will illuminate them in full at the next equinox, in 2050, so a spacecraft still in orbit then could see all of Uranus and its regular moons. The challenges of reaching these distant worlds are great, but the scientifi c rewards are likely to be far greater. ¢ Ever since childhood KEN CROSWELL has been especially intrigued by distant and mysterious Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. He is the author of eight books, including Planet Quest and Ten Worlds. uMOON SHARD Little Hippocamp (about 18 km across) appears around Neptune in this Hubble Space Telescope composite.

From blistering cold to sky-darkening dust storms, Mars could kill you in so many ways. Typical Martian Conditions The Martian atmosphere is clear and dry, but it's thin, bearing down on the surface with only about 1% of Earth's surface pressure. In composition, it's 95% carbon dioxide (CO2), which we can't breathe, with traces of nitrogen and argon and only minuscule amounts of water vapor and oxy-gen. Most of that oxygen comes from the breakdown of CO2 by harsh levels of ultraviolet solar radiation, which barrages the surface because the planet doesn't have a protective ozone layer like Earth does. Mars is on average about 50% farther from the Sun than Earth is, so it shouldn't be surprising that the environment is colder. However, the nature and magnitude of the coldness would be stunning to even the heartiest Arctic dwellers on our planet. Near the peak of summer, near the equator, the surface temperature during the "heat of the day" can briefl y go above freezing, perhaps to 5°C to 10°C (41°F to 50°F) or more in certain places. But during most other times of the year, conditions are much more frigid, averaging more like −25°C to −10°C in the daytime and dipping down below −100°C on many nights. And that's the temperature at your feet — as you raise your thermometer up off the surface only a meter or two, the midday temperature can drop by 20°C to 30°C. Cozy toes but frozen nose. Just like on Earth, it's colder the closer you get to the poles, and if you go far enough north or south in the winter, it gets so cold that the CO2 starts to snow out onto the surface, forming dry ice. There is no similar analogy on Earth, because the water vapor that turns to snow and falls to the ground here is just a tiny fraction of the gas in our atmosphere. For it to snow on Earth like it does on Mars, the temperatures would have to drop to around −200°C so that our primary atmospheric gas, nitrogen, started to snow out onto the sur-face. Brrrrr . . . Unprotected on the surface, you would not only suffocate and get the mother of all sunburns, but you'd also freeze to death. Funky Seasons Planets have seasons because of the tilt of their rotational axes — their obliquity — relative to the plane of their orbit around the Sun. The tilt determines how directly sunlight hits a hemi-sphere — or, in the extreme case of Uranus, whether sunlight reaches the hemisphere at all (see page 16). Earth's obliquity of 23.5° results in the winter, spring, summer, and fall seasons familiar to people living in mid-latitudes, as well as the long summer days and long winter nights familiar to people living closer to the poles. Jupiter and Mercury have almost no obliq-uity, so those planets do not have appreciable seasons. The obliquity of Mars (25.2°) is currently similar to that of Earth. Thus the planet has Earth-like seasons, though they're approximately twice as long as our planet's because of Mars's greater distance from the Sun. The more direct sunlight in the summertime means warmer temperatures, which in turn provide more energy to fuel storms — both Earthlike systems dominated by thin, water-ice clouds and distinctly Martian dust devils and dust storms. Complicating obliquity's effect, however, is Mars's orbital eccentricity. Its orbit is far more elongated than Earth's, which has a signifi cant infl uence on the weather. Specifi cally, Mars's orbital eccentricity of 0.09 means that the planet's distance from the Sun changes from 1.38 astronomical units at perihelion (around southern summer/northern winter) to 1.67 a.u. at aphelion. That change in distance results in a whopping 45% increase in the amount of sunlight that the planet receives around perihelion compared to aphelion. In comparison, Earth's orbital eccentricity of just 0.017 results in only about a 7% change in the intensity of sun-light between January, when we're closest to the Sun, and July, when we're farthest. The Red Planet's more elongated orbit also means that the duration of southern summer is q POLAR CAP This four-image mosaic from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's MARCI camera shows the perennial north polar cap (white) atop layered material (light tan) and circumpolar dunes (dark brown).

The large increase in solar energy input during southern spring and summer increases the average surface tempera-ture, driving stronger daily winds, fueling more frequent storms, and helping to occasionally raise surface tempera-tures at latitudes near the equator above the freezing point of water. Conversely, the long polar nights during each hemi-sphere's winter season enable the surface temperatures to drop low enough (down to around −125°C) for up to about 1 meter (3 feet) of those famous CO2 snow and ice deposits to accumulate. Sadly, the physics of dry ice and even water ice at Mars polar temperatures and pressures means that traditional skiing or sledding isn't possible; fans of such winter sports will have to fi nd other pastimes, or invent new Mars-specifi c equipment technologies to feed their passions. Uniquely Martian Storms Just like on Earth, storms represent an important component of Martian weather on daily and seasonal time scales. Storms on Mars come in a range of sizes, from small house-size vortices comparable to terrestrial dust devils, to larger city-size moving walls of dust similar in some ways to terrestrial desert haboobs, to large-scale fronts that travel across major fractions of the surface, to fully planet-encircling systems that can dramatically affect the planet's surface and atmospheric temperatures. Scientists can monitor storms on all these scales using telescopes, orbiters, and surface landers and rovers. These instruments measure the way that the storms create and move clouds of both dust and water ice. They also help us study the way that movement of dust and sand can change the surface albedo over time. Despite some superfi cial similarities to terrestrial storms, however, Martian storms are signifi cantly different from the kinds of storms that we are used to. For example, even though the planet's dust devils and dust storms can spin or move across the surface with hurricane-like wind speeds, the force exerted by those winds is extremely weak because the planet's atmosphere is so thin. Indeed, even the most extreme Martian storms, with wind speeds of up to about 180 kph (112 mph), would feel to us like a gentle breeze of around 21 kph (13 mph). That might disappoint those of us who imag-ine our neighboring planet's tempests clobbering the surface like in the famous sandstorm scene early in the movie The Martian. Although the storm provided a dramatic introduction to the fi lm's compelling "human vs. nature" theme, it's actually pure fi ction. Rather than fi ghting intensely blowing sand and fl ying debris ripped off their habitats, astronauts like Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney, would instead have experienced something more like fast-moving feathers or dandelion seeds "pummeling" their Dust devil Midday Temperatures on Mars Astronauts' heads would be about 20° colder than their feet. –10ºC –30ºC A S T R O N A U T I C O N : A R T E M K O V Y A Z IN / T H E N O U N P R O J E C T ; M ID -D A Y T E M P E R A T U R E S : T E R R I D U B É / S & T ; D U S T D E V IL : N A S A / J P L / M S S S s k ya nd te l e scope .com • D EC E M B E R 2 019 27 spacesuits. That kind of meteorological real-ity would probably not have been as popular with Hollywood or moviegoers. Time After Time Nonetheless, even though the forces exerted by the winds are weak, they can have dra-matic effects on the planet's weather, as well as on the surface itself. Martian storms are persistent and highly repeatable from sol to sol, season to season, year to year — and probably over the hundreds of millions to few billions of years that the planet's environ-mental conditions have been comparable to what they are today. Scientists have been able to monitor the weather on Mars for centuries using Earth-based telescopic observations, but only in the past few decades has it become possible to observe weather patterns form, move, and evolve on Mars at a scale comparable to what we routinely get from terrestrial weather satellites. These stunning data sets, which now span nearly a dozen Mar-tian years, come from the wide-angle color photos taken from orbit by the NASA Mars Global Surveyor mission's Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC; from 1997 through 2006), and then the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft's Mars Color Imager (MARCI; still active since 2006). MOC and MARCI researchers have created daily global maps of atmospheric storms and surface albedo changes nearly continuously for almost 8,000 sols — an unprecedented record that has fi nally laid bare numerous secrets about the weather on Mars. For example, time-lapse imaging over more than a Mars-decade has revealed that, as on Earth, there are specifi c storm tracks that fronts and weather systems take as they move across the planet. Among the most commonly traveled paths is a track that begins in the north polar region and extends southward along the dark region known as Acidalia Planitia, not far from the Mars Pathfi nder landing site. Another storm track runs through the Utopia Planitia region, not far from the Viking 2 landing site. Several other common north-south paths have also been discovered. They all appear to be at least partly associated with winds intensifi ed by two phenomena: temperature differences between bright polar ice caps and dark ice-free surface regions, and topographic dif-ferences between large low-lying basins and surrounding highland terrains. The paths taken by storms traveling south along these northern hemisphere tracks eventually cross the equator, where they begin to fan out and move in more east-west directions, partly because the terrain in the southern hemi-sphere is generally higher and more rugged compared to the northern one. In general, the weather on Mars appears much more repeatable and much less chaotic than the weather on Earth. Remarkably, many of the same kinds of local storms occur in the same places and at the same times of year from Martian year to Martian year. For example, several times we've observed dust storms forming within the same part of the Valles Marineris canyon system at almost precisely the same time each year. Likewise, vortex-like storm systems of thin water-ice clouds peel off the north polar cap on nearly the same dates during each year's northern summer. This kind of repeatability is unprec-edented on our planet — it would be like the same storm starting at exactly the same place on Earth on exactly the same day, every year. Dust Storm Season Another discovery from decades of weather satellite observations is that, for the smaller-scale storms, there really is no such thing as a general "dust storm season" on Mars. The concept was proposed in the mid-20th cen-tury based on Earth-based telescopic obser-vations, which of course could only detect and monitor the largest storms on Mars, and then only for the part of the Martian year when the planet was closest to Earth. Monitoring the Martian weather up close, however, has revealed that there are dust storms on Mars essentially every sol. Some of them form from winds coming off the uDÉJÀ VU In fi ve successive northern summers, a water-ice cloud formed off the polar cap.

Others form more locally, as winds move across hills or canyons and become turbulent, or as warmer air rises out of craters or cooler air descends down mountain fl anks. The combined MOC and MARCI observational record shows that smaller dust storms frequently merge into larger regional storms. However, we still don't fully understand what occasionally causes them to merge into even larger hemispheric or truly global dust storms that shroud the sur-face from telescopic and orbital view and blot out the sur-face's view of the Sun. Astronomers observed many such enormous storms in the 19th and 20th centuries; among the more recent ones are those in 1971 just before NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft went into orbit, in 1977 during the Viking Lander missions, in 2001, and in 2007. The most recent global dust storm on Mars began in June 2018 and lasted for several months, turning daytime into night in the skies above NASA's solar-powered rover Opportunity and ultimately killing that robot after more than 14 years of successful operations on the Red Planet (S&T: Sept. 2019, p. 24). As with the regional storms, the trigger for global dust storms on Mars is still a mystery. What we do know is that, unlike for smaller storms, there is a preferred season for the largest ones: Most occur during the "heat" of southern sum-mer. The timing indicates that the increased energy of the southern summer's more intense sunlight fuels these enor-mous tempests. However, just like for hurricane season on Earth, there are also relatively chaotic local to regional effects from the atmosphere and surface that frustrate global dust storm forecasting. It's not yet possible to predict exactly how many large dust storms will occur each Martian year, or even whether a global-scale storm will occur at all. On a smaller scale, the important weather factor that appears to initiate many of the dust storms on Mars is the wind stress, a drag exerted on the surface by the passing wind. If the wind stress is above a certain threshold, the wind can lift the tiny (smoke-size) grains of dust that cover the high albedo regions of the planet, keeping that dust airborne for weeks or even months at a time. In fact, the famous reddish sky of Mars photographed by landers and rovers is evidence that there is always some dust suspended in the Martian atmosphere. The oxidized iron in the dust grains absorbs most of the sunlight's blueish wavelengths and scatters its reddish ones, giving the Martian sky its distinctive tan hue. Indeed, if there were no dust in the atmosphere, the sky would be dark blue or perhaps even black (comparable to being on the Moon) because the atmosphere is so thin. The airborne dust also gives Mars its distinctive blueish sunrises and sunsets. When the Sun is low in the sky, its light has to pass through much more of the atmosphere to reach a rover's cameras than it does at other times of day, and many more of the redder hues of sunlight are scattered away. Changes in the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere determine how blue the sunrise or sunset is — an ironic and visually stunning contrast to the varying blushes of sunrise and sunset on our own planet. Dust is not only a key part of Mars's weather, it is a key part of Mars's character. Long-Term Forecast Just like on Earth, the distinction between weather (day-to-day environmental and meteorological phenomena) and climate (decades- or centuries-long weather trends) is crucial to understanding Mars. Surface, atmospheric, and satellite observations of the Red Planet are helping us to measure the sol-to-sol weather as well as to learn about long-term climate changes. Although Mars's climate is now far less volatile than Earth's, there is ample evidence in the geologic and atmo-spheric record that the planet's environment wasn't always GLOBAL STORM These images from the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter show a 2001 regional dust storm in the basin Hellas (left, basin is bright oval feature) that within a few days exploded across the planet, ultimately veiling the planet in dust (right).

Roughly 3½ billion years ago, this climate gave way to one infl uenced by widespread volcanism and episodic seas of water, then glaciers. Today's frozen desert is the result of this eons-long climatic evolution. The evolution is currently at a standstill. The Martian climate will not change drastically in the near future — at least, not without help. Futurists have suggested that we might eventually be able to change the environment of the Red Planet by adding more heat-blanketing greenhouse gases to thicken its atmosphere, until the day-to-day weather and long-term climate match Earth-like conditions. However, such terraforming would take centuries to millen-nia, if not longer. Some researchers estimate that there is not enough CO2 locked up in ice and rocks on Mars to even make it possible. So if we want to send people to Mars in the much nearer future, we will have to fi nd a way to live on the Red Planet the way it is, in all its stark, deadly beauty. The detailed understanding of Martian weather that is coming from recent and current robotic orbit-ers, landers, and rovers will become part of the common wisdom and daily reality of life for the fi rst human settlers on the Red Planet. And perhaps they will be the ones who — spacesuited-up in layers to deal with the enormous daily swings in temperature, chipping away at the last of the long winter's dry ice, and battling (gentle) occa-sional dust storms — will uncover the deeper secrets still preserved on the Red Planet. ¢ JIM BELL is an astronomer and planetary scientist at Arizona State University and the president of The Planetary Society.

On the night in question, afternoon clouds earlier in the day had lowered my spirits, but a clearing twilight later raised them. I didn't need an SQM, or sky quality meter, reading to tell me that sky conditions were sterling: The winter Milky Way and zodiacal light were intense. I grabbed my 6-inch (15-cm) f/2.8 telescope with a 4.3° fi eld of view and pointed it at my target: the vast Eridanus Superbubble west of Orion. I warmed up on the Orion Nebula (M42) then pushed over to the Horsehead Nebula to test sky conditions. Whoa, I could see the Horsehead without need for a fi lter, and the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) appeared sizeable. I scanned northward to check out the Lambda (λ) Orionis Ring, Sharpless 2-264. The edge was bright and curved in the wrong direction. Oh, I was see-ing the northern reach of Barnard's Loop and it was obvious! I traced the Loop to the east and found M78 fl oating brightly in a sea of smoky nebulosity, then continued tracing the Loop as it arced below M42. Transparency was the best it had been in months. Drawing what you see through the eyepiece adds another layer to your observing experi-ence. Join the author as he explores the Orion–Eridanus Superbubble region, sketchpad at the ready. t THE ORION–ERIDANUS SUPERBUBBLE The sketch at left covers an area about 30° × 25° and corresponds to the box in the image on page 30. It's also reproduced in the chart above. It took the author more than three years to produce this sketch, which he assembled as a mosaic from a series of multi-fi eld sketches as described in the text. The circle represents his 6-inch telescope's 4.3° fi eld of view. 4.3º fi eld Observing Logbook 32 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE The Project Begins My fi rst quarry of the night was Sh 2-245. Digital images of Sh 2-245 suggest that this nebula is a tad dimmer than Sh 2-264, the one that envelops Lambda Orionis, and Bar-nard's Loop. Since I'd also viewed these latter two with my 13-inch (33-cm) f/3.0 telescope with 1.8° fi eld of view with some margin to spare, I had hopes for Sh 2-245. Of course, one never knows — sometimes the object is visible and at other times it just can't be seen. Finding Sh 2-245, also known as the Fishhook Neb-ula, was one of the easiest star-hops I've come across. Nu (ν) Tauri is an easy hop from the Hyades open cluster. It has a companion star that's not visible to the unaided eye. A little less than 3° below Nu (as seen in my telescope) is a fainter pair next to a 5.3-magnitude star (HD 25621). I aimed my 13-inch at the fainter pair, which according to deep digital images was adjacent to the brightest portion of Sh 2-245. There it was! There was the nebula! Instantly vis-ible as a bright streak, there was no need for averted vision or careful studying of the fi eld until whatever nebulosity present slowly came into view. I returned to the 6-inch and was rewarded with an obvious streak, though not as bright. I followed the streak northward as it expanded in width, and then followed it southward for about 10°. Dimmer but still visible, I could trace the nebula through a split that looked like a Y. The eastern end faded into the background, while the western end faded into the zodiacal light. qBIT BY BIT . . . Sketching a structure the size of the Orion–Eridanus Superbubble doesn't happen overnight. The author builds the master sketch by observing and sketching various features and then combining them in a fi nal redrawing of the whole. Below at left is Sh 2-264 and at right Sh 2-245, the Fishhook Nebula. I sketch to record my observations, what I see in the eyepiece. There's surprising variety in the visual appearance of astronomical objects across types and sizes of telescopes, and even across the eye-pieces we carry in our telescope cases. Throw in fi lters and changing sky conditions and that image of the Dumbbell Nebula (M27) will look quite dif-ferent, much as processing results in dramatically different images of the Dumbbell depending on the narrative that the imager wishes to tell. The process of sketching — how I go about each drawing, the tools I use, pencils and stumps — also infl uences the story I'm telling. Oftentimes stars are critical to the view, so I'll position them precisely, record-ing as many as I can manage. Sometimes, though, M E L B A R T E L S ( 4 ) s k ya nd te l e scope .com • D EC E M B E R 2 019 33 when stars aren't important, I'll only draw the asterisms that catch my eye as landmarks. I enjoy the tremendous luxury of observing from my driveway under dark skies. I plan extensively for the night's action in order to maximize my time at the tele-scope. Since I don't need to drive any distance to set up, my observing sessions tend to be intense affairs. Although I do some quicker sketching at star parties, I fi nd interruptions when working on my larger projects distracting. It reminds me of earlier days when one had to manually guide long-exposure astrophotographs. Before I start multi-fi eld drawings, I create a PDF of the star fi eld with key stars and asterisms marked. This allows me to readily draw any broad nebulosity that spans many fi elds when I move my scope back and forth across the star fi eld in sweeps. To illustrate my technique, at right are two examples that show how my sketches develop. At top is a series of progressive sketches of the supernova remnant SNR G065.3+05.7. The circles represent my telescopes' fi elds of view: I used my 13- and 6-inch, as well as my 10.5-inch (27-cm) f/2.7 with 2.5° fi eld of view. My drawing shows how each telescope contributes specifi c detail. At bot-tom is a sketch of three overlapping draw-ings of the supernova remnant Sh 2-240 (Simeis 147), known more whimsically as the Spaghetti Nebula, that straddles the border between Auriga and Taurus. The supernova from which this remnant sprang is thought to have occurred 40,000 years ago. It's con-sidered a diffi cult observation due to its low surface brightness. Nonetheless, fi lamen-tary structure is visible in a circular shell. For sketching, I used my 10.5-inch telescope. Ahead of time, I printed out only a backdrop of stars and identifi ed the key ones to use as markers. Outside, under the stars, I swung the telescope back and forth between the key stars to delineate the area to sketch, and then began fi lling in the sketch one fi eld at a time. I also work on successive multi-fi eld sketches to catch more of the faint nebulosity. Observing Logbook 34 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE The Superbubble I began sketching the Eridanus Superbubble three years ago, concentrating on the brighter eastern side, where Sh 2-245 resides. In researching how to tackle the western side, I carefully selected four anchor stars from which to begin my explorations: Alpha (α) Ceti (Menkar), the southeast corner of Cetus's head; 10 Tauri to the east; Delta (δ) Eridani (Rana) to the south; and Gamma (γ) Eridani (Zaurak) to the extreme southeast. I settled on Menkar and then slid half a fi eld to the east. At that moment I knew I had the begin-nings of a memorable night: The Eridanus Superbubble was imme-diately noticeable, and with good detail. In fact, there was so much relatively bright nebulosity to concentrate on that I opted not to track down the faint stuff. Particularly beautiful were the "Leaping Man" south of Rana, dark nebulae near 10 Tauri, the Y and X south of 10 Tauri, chaotic fi laments southeast of Menkar, and the lacy great oblong area leading to 1 Eridani, southeast of Cetus. The brighter sections were obvious and easy, just a little fainter than Barnard's Loop; the fainter portions were about as bright as IC 434, the nebula associated with the Horsehead, but easier to see because of their larger scale. To the extreme western (left) edge of my fi nal sketch on page 31 lies an inter-esting circular region of nebulosity and dark nebulae begging to be investigated with greater aperture and scale. For sketching, I began by selecting two anchor stars — in this case they were Menkar and 10 Tauri. I centered on Men-kar, then practiced sweeping to 10 Tauri and back. I verifi ed that I crossed Kappa1 (κ1) Ceti and its handle of three stars to the northeast. I then penciled in the nebulos-ity, noting brightness, sharpness of edges, and shape. After that, I moved on to the next destination star or asterism, practiced sweep-ing back and forth, and recorded my observations. Following a number of sweeps, each encom-passing many degrees of fi eld of view, I gradually built up a sketch of the 15° × 20° Superbubble. When I was satisfi ed that I was fi nished, I compiled a fi nal sketch, using my fi eld sketches and notes accumulated over the three years of this project. What greatly helped me with the Superbubble is that I've developed a super-wide-fi eld observing technique that dissolves the eyepiece's fi eld stop. It's critically important to properly position my eye with respect to my lowest-power eyepiece, which has a 100° apparent fi eld of view. My eye executes a slow stop-and-go dance across the fi eld, a combi-nation of purposeful movements and focusing on interesting detail that catches my attention. This allows me to ferret out brighter and darker areas and their boundaries. Tighter eye movements yield smaller and more detailed detections. For very large objects, I move the scope back and forth. The eyepiece's fi eld stop seems to disappear; at the same time, I perceive a much larger fi eld of view. This "shakes loose" dif-fi cult, larger-scale objects. It's funny where a great night takes you. I undertook a quest for new super-vast, wider-angle telescopes to see super-nova remnants as never before. Then I found myself devising new observing techniques to capture the entire supernova remnant. Now when I look through the eyepiece, I instinc-tively move my eye to and fro and move the telescope back and forth, rendering the fi eld stop invisible and opening up the sky to my imagination.

And every year we face the same problem: how to gently tell some of them that what they've got is better suited for a boat anchor than for astronomy. It may be hard to believe, but some telescopes are worse than having no scope at all. When you want to enjoy a night out under the stars, you're better off with a pair of binoculars or just with your naked eyes than with a telescope that can't be aimed easily and doesn't show a pleasing view of whatever you do manage to point it at. I've watched people spend all night trying to fi nd something, anything, to look at, often spending their entire time fi ddling with the scope rather than observing the sky. It only takes a couple of nights like that for a person to decide that astronomy isn't any fun — thus the term "hobby killer." As with so many other things in life, education can help you avoid making frustrating mistakes. If you're a beginner, a few minutes reading this article before you buy a tele-scope can save you a lot of disappointment later. Making an informed choice can get you a scope that will provide you with many years of enjoyment. So what makes a hobby killer? Many factors add together to make a lousy overall package. Chief among them are aper-ture, eyepieces, and the mount. Here's how to avoid buying an expensive doorstop. U N L E S S O T H E R W IS E N O T E D A L L IM A G E S C O U R T E S Y O F T H E A U T H O R s k ya nd te l e scope .com • D EC E M B E R 2 019 37 Aperture A telescope's primary job is to gather light and squeeze that light down into a small beam that it directs into your eye. It stands to reason that the more light you gather, the more you can see. So in general, the bigger the aperture (the diameter of the objective lens or primary mirror) the more useful the scope. That's true up to a point, but if you buy a scope that's too big and unwieldy, it could become a hobby killer simply because it's too diffi cult to take outside and set up. What you want is the right-size scope for your interest level and ability. Anything below about 3 inches (76 mm) in aperture is likely to be too small to provide a pleasing view of anything more than the Moon and a few bright star clusters. Small scopes tend to be low-quality, too, with uncorrected objec-tive lenses that display color fringing around bright objects and often won't even come to sharp focus. So as a general rule, stay above three inches in aperture. There are, of course, some very high-end small scopes, mostly optimized for astro-photography. The price tag will tell you which is which. Most small hobby killers tend to be refractors (with an objective lens in front) rather than refl ectors (with a mirror at the bottom). Mirrors are easier to make than lenses, so within any particular price range refl ectors tend to be larger. So a typical low-end refl ector will be 4″ or so in diameter. A very common size is 4.5″, and 4.5″ is plenty of aperture for a fi rst scope. You can see hundreds of objects with a good 4.5″ scope. The key word is "good." There are rotten refl ectors as well as rotten refractors. What makes a refl ector good? Most KILLING THE VIEW While this scope may look pretty good, its equatorial mount, lousy fi nder, 60-mm aperture, 0.965″ eyepiece, and 3× Barlow make it a hobby killer. HARD TO HANDLE Even a great scope can be a hobby killer if it's too diffi cult to carry. important: Is the primary mirror parabolic or spherical? A spherical primary is cheaper to make but provides a less pleas-ing view. You can get away with a spherical mirror if the focal ratio is "slow" enough, say f/8 or more (i.e., the focal length of the scope is 8 times the diameter of the mirror), but even then a parabolic mirror will work better. If a manufacturer of a low-end telescope goes to the trouble to parabolize the pri-mary mirror, then odds are it's a reasonably good telescope. There's one design you should avoid at all costs: the "Bird-Jones" refl ector. The Bird-Jones design uses a spheri-cal primary, and a fast one at that, in an attempt to keep the tube shorter than average. Manufacturers of this design correct for spherical aberration and increase the focal length Advice for Buyers 38 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE by placing a corrector lens at the inner end of the focuser. The corrector lens is supposed to make everything all right again, but it never does. The view through every Bird-Jones scope I've ever looked through has been uniformly awful. There might be a decent Bird-Jones telescope somewhere out there, but if there is, I've never seen nor even heard of it. Eyepieces In the early days of telescopes, eyepieces were single pieces of glass that essentially acted as magnifying lenses that let you examine the image created at the focal plane by the objective lens or primary mirror. Modern eyepieces do the same job, but they use many more lens elements to correct for color fringing and other optical aberrations. Different designs of eyepiece give you different fi elds of view. Some, such as the Orthoscopic design, are like looking through a soda straw, while other exotic wide-fi eld designs are like sticking your head into the bubble-shaped observing port on the International Space Station. Guess which kind you get with a hobby killer? Most of them come with "Huygens" eyepieces, which were state of the art when Christiaan Huygens invented them . . . in the 1660s. We've advanced a bit since then. You want at least Kellners, or better yet, Plössls. Plössl eyepieces are probably the best value you can get in an inexpensive eyepiece. Also beware of teeny-weeny eyepieces. Good eyepieces are either 1.25″ or 2″ format, meaning their barrels are meant to fi t into 1.25″ or 2″ focusers. A lot of hobby killers use 0.965″ eyepieces, which are almost always garbage and are hard to replace with better-quality designs due to this size limitation. Magnifi cation You'll want more than one eyepiece, because eyepieces are how you control the magnifi cation of your telescope. You STARTING OUT RIGHT The Orion StarBlast 4.5 Astro Refl ec-tor Telescope is an excellent starter scope. STEPPING UP A 6″ (seen below) or 8″ Dobsonian is a great step up from a 4.5″ StarBlast. pCOMMON FORMATS Avoid scopes that use 0.965″ eyepieces. Left to right: 0.965″, 1¼″, and 2″ eyepieces. https://avxlive.icu/ https://avxlive.icu/ s k ya nd te l e scope .com • D EC E M B E R 2 019 39 calculate magnifi cation by dividing the eyepiece focal length into the telescope's focal length. For instance, a 900-mm telescope with a 25-mm eyepiece gives you 36× — (900/25 = 36). You might think you want the highest magnifi cation possible, but that's not so. The higher the power, the smaller the fi eld of view, which means you'll only see a part of M45, the Pleiades star cluster, or M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. Also, the higher the power, the fuzzier the view. A good telescope lets you reach about 50× per inch of aperture before the fuzziness gets out of hand, so a 3″ scope would let you use 150×, but beyond that you're just magnifying the blur, a phenomenon known as empty magnifi cation. That means a 3″ by 900-mm telescope can use a 6-mm eyepiece, at best — (900/6 = 150). So there's a clue when you go shopping. Does the ad on the website or on the box tout the telescope's magnifi cation? If it's a 3″ aperture and they're advertising that it will do "675×!!!" they're blowing smoke. Move on. Most hobby killers will come with a 4-mm eyepiece, which is nearly useless on its own, but it will also come with a Barlow lens, which increases the magnifi cation of whatever eyepiece you put into it. Most Barlows multiply by 2×, so your 4-mm eyepiece plus Barlow on that 900-mm scope gives you a whop-ping 450×, or (900/4) ×2. Remembering our 50× per inch rule, you would need a 9″ diameter telescope to use 450× effectively. What you want for your telescope is a good low-power eyepiece, probably a 32-mm or 25-mm Plössl, and a medium-power eyepiece, around a 10-mm Plössl. You can increase your collection as you gain experience. The Mount This is the real killer. A great scope with the best eyepieces in the world can still become a hobby killer when it's put on a lousy mount. I'll make an absolute statement here: An equatorial mount is a poor mount for a beginner. Later on, when your hobby has fl ourished, say you concentrate on planetary observing or have taken up astrophotography, you might happily consider paying tens of thousands of dollars for the best equato-rial mount on the planet. But to start out with, equatorial mounts are simply awful. They're diffi cult to set up, diffi cult to use, and the cheap ones are shakier than a leaf in a breeze. Equatorial mounts are not just diffi cult to use, they're dif-fi cult to even comprehend at fi rst. Simply trying to fi gure out how to orient the thing has killed the enthusiasm of many would-be astronomers. So don't get an equatorially mounted telescope until you've q EMPTY PROMISES Ads can be deceptive. Don't be fooled by outra-geous marketing claims! tREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS Saturn will look dim and blurry at 400× in a 70-mm refractor. A more modest 200× in a better telescope will pro-duce a much more pleasing image. been in the hobby awhile. Or never: Most observers don't require an equatorial track-ing mount. Altitude-Azimuth (alt-az) mounts are the way to go. For refractors, that means a solid mount on a steady tripod that lets you tilt the scope up and down and swivel it left and right. The scope should move smoothly, and it should stop when you stop push-ing without bouncing back and without wiggling. If you tap the end of the telescope tube and it takes more than 3 or 4 seconds to settle down, you don't want that mount. For refl ectors, the Dobsonian mount is the way to go (with one exception: the Orion StarBlast mentioned below). It's basically a cannon mount, and it works like a dream. It's stable, smooth, and intuitive. When John Dobson introduced this mount to the astronomical world back in the 1970s, he made this hobby truly accessible for the fi rst time. See my column on page 72 on how to use Dobson's design to breathe new life into a poorly mounted hobby killer. Computerized Mounts More and more lately you'll fi nd hobby killers that have been computerized. The computer itself doesn't necessarily make it a hobby killer, although it can if the mount is a piece of junk, which most of the truly low-end ones are. It's just that putting a lousy little scope on a computerized mount doesn't make the scope perform any better. Advice for Buyers 40 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE "No knowledge necessary!" the ads will say. Aside from the fact that most of us get into astronomy to learn stuff, that's seldom true anyway. With a low-end Go To scope (which is what the computerized ones are called), you're likely to learn quite a bit of computer debugging and maybe even mechanical repair skills before you even get your fi rst look through one. Seriously, I have seen people spend their entire night fi ddling with the electronics, trying in vain to get the computer to work properly, and never once getting to look at anything in the sky. On the other hand, a good computerized mount can be an amazing experience. Several manufacturers now build systems that recognize the star fi eld when you power them on and reliably know where to go when you tell them what you want to look at. It's just that these good systems cost a fair amount of money, and you're unlikely to get a good one at a beginner's-scope price. Recommendations There are too many awful scopes out there to name them all. But I can happily name some good ones. Over the years, I've narrowed it down to three I can endorse without reservation: Since you get more bang for your buck with mirrors, I recommend that your fi rst scope be a refl ector. The Orion 4.5 StarBlast Astro Refl ector Telescope is a good place to start. It's easy to carry, easy to set up, and easy to use. The Astronomi-cal League and many individual astronomy clubs give these to libraries to loan out to patrons, and the scopes provide great views and survive a lot of use. If you have a little more money and don't mind a bigger package, go for a 6″ or 8″ Dobsonian. I like the SkyQuest or SkyLine lines, also from Orion, but other manufacturers make good Dobs, too — Meade's LightBridge series telescopes are worth checking out. I recommend a 6″ as a good grab-and-go scope that you won't outgrow right away. If you've got enough muscle to carry something a bit larger, get the 8″ and it'll last you a lifetime. With the Dobs, get a 10-mm Plössl eyepiece to go with the 25-mm that often comes with it. There are undoubtedly other good beginners' scopes out there. But there's a lot of dreck, too. Pay attention, and try to avoid buying something that you'll never use.

NIGHT: The Geminid meteor shower is expected to peak during the day of the 14th and is normally best viewed on both the preceding and following nights. However, this year the waning gibbous Moon will hide all but the brightest meteors; see page 48. MORNING: The Moon, almost at last quarter, is in Leo, some 3° to 4° from the Lion's heart, Regulus. MORNING: The waning gibbous Moon, now in Virgo, is around 5° from Porrima and about twice that distance from Spica. THE LONGEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR in the Northern Hemisphere.

The effect may be more psychological than meteorological, but the cold air seems clearer and the stars seem to shine more brightly. It's a great season for binocular observing, especially when it's too chilly for me to want to set up a scope. One of my favorite targets this time of year is the open cluster NGC 752 in the southeastern reaches of the constellation Andromeda. The cluster is a bright, easy catch, just west of an imaginary line between Gamma (γ) Andromedae and Beta (β) Trianguli. In my old logbook I described it as a "big diffuse ball of stars, like a swarm of fi refl ies." As is often the case, that initial impression cap-tured more reality than I knew at the time. If the stars of NGC 752 resemble fi refl ies, it's because so many of them are yellow-orange and orange subgiants and giants. NGC 752 is an aging cluster, a little more than 1 billion years old. It may seem strange to describe a cluster as "old" when it's only a quarter the age of our own solar system, but our Sun is a comparatively small star that will burn for billions of years yet. The small stars of NGC 752 are lost in the brighter lights of their larger, faster-burning siblings. Here's a comparison for you to make: NGC 752 lies about 1,500 light-years away, almost exactly the same distance as M42 and M43, which together constitute the Great Nebula in Orion, the Hunter. A little more than a billion years ago, a similar nebula gave birth to NGC 752. The cluster prefi gures M42's remote future, and the nebula embodies NGC 752's distant past. How wonderful that we can cross thou-sands of light-years and billions of years with instru-ments we hold in our hands. ¢ MATT WEDEL is probably out in the cold and the dark, adrift in space and time, happy as a clam.

The Moon is plotted for evening dates in the Americas when it's waxing (right side illuminated) or full, and for morning dates when it's waning (left side). "Local time of transit" tells when (in Local Mean Time) objects cross the meridian — that is, when they appear due south and at their highest — at mid-month. Transits occur an hour later on the 1st, and an hour earlier at month's end. The table above gives each object's right ascension and declination (equinox 2000.0) at 0h Universal Time on selected dates, and its elongation from the Sun in the morning (Mo) or evening (Ev) sky. Next are the visual magnitude and equatorial diameter. (Saturn's ring extent is 2.27 times its equatorial diameter.) Last are the percentage of a planet's disk illuminated by the Sun and the distance from Earth in astronomical units. (Based on the mean Earth–Sun distance, 1 a.u. is 149,597,871 kilometers, or 92,955,807 international miles.) For other dates, see skyandtelescope.com/almanac.

His work contains some notable references to the stars. For instance, the fi nal line of "Who Goes with Fergus?" reads: "And all dishevelled wandering stars." The planets have been called "wandering stars," but I think that in this line Yeats is referring to purely stel-lar objects. The line always makes me think of the Coma Star Cluster in Coma Berenices, for that irregular scattering of naked-eye stars reminds me, as it did the ancients, of the beautifully dishev-elled hair of Queen Berenice. But Yeats is probably describing the dishevelled nature of the stars' twinkling, appropri-ate to the tone of the poem. Now for the other potential astro-nomical references in the passages excerpted above. The explicit mention of stars dancing "silver-sandalled" on the sea and singing a high and lonely tune isn't the one that moves me the most. For me, the line that stirs cosmic thoughts — thoughts about the universe — is the line about "eternal beauty." Astronomical beauties wandering on their way. I devoted much of the Perpetual Motion Everything in the universe is constantly on the move. September and October installments of this column to the ancientness of most astronomical objects. But the central theme was eternity and what I called the interface of now and for-ever. We always live on this interface but very rarely become fully aware of it. Yet we can do so, and revel in the thrill of it, when we passionately undertake astronomical observation. Why? Because observing allows us to compress into one evening's, even one hour's, personal experience the millions or billions of years of our targets' ages, and the seconds or minutes to billions of years that their light has traveled to us across the cosmos. There is, however, another aspect of what we see in the heavens that can increase our wonder and recognition of beauty in the universe. I'm talking about recognizing the glorious sym-phony of motion created by the move-ments of all the objects and collections of objects out there. A December night's symphony of motion. On a calm and clear December night, all may seem wonderfully silent and still. But everything in the universe is really in motion. We don't live in a static cosmos. When we fi rst try our hand at astronomical observing, we have to learn how our rotating and orbit-ing Earth affects our perception of the movements of celestial objects. Then we can start appreciating the one-apparent-Moon-width-per-hour eastward travel of the Moon, and the slower, statelier march of the planets in their orbits. The mobility of the Moon and the planets is mostly gauged against the seemingly fi xed background stars. But even that background is in richly complicated motion. At the time of our December sky map, the Androm-eda Galaxy is overhead — and heading toward us in space. Aldebaran, in the east, is heading rapidly away from us in space. The Pleiades are fl ying like a fl ock of doves to the southeast. Run-away stars in Auriga and Columba are hurtling away from the central region of Orion where their partner stars went supernova millions of years ago, send-ing them fl ying. All of these ancient astronomical objects — and we short-lived human beings who nevertheless perceive the universe — are all part of eternal beauty wandering on her way. ¢ FRED SCHAAF welcomes your letters and comments at fschaaf@aol.com.

Magnitude –1.8 Jupiter is lost from view in bright twilight by about mid-month and reaches conjunction with the Sun on December 27th. The big show for much of Decem-ber is magnitude –3.9 Venus, getting higher with each night, passing mag-nitude +0.6 Saturn, which gets lower. On December 6th, Venus and Saturn are 5° apart, and binoculars help show 2nd-magnitude Nunki, or Sigma (σ) Sagittarii, less than 2° from Venus. On December 10th and 11th, Venus and Saturn are a little less than 2° apart, with Saturn to the upper right. In tele-scopes, Venus then displays a 12″-wide disk that is about 87% illuminated and Saturn a 15″-wide disk with 35″-wide rings. On these dates, Venus and Saturn set about 2 hours after the Sun. But over the next few weeks, Venus races away and up, improving its sunset and twilight altitudes, while Saturn sinks ever lower and fi nally disappears from view by late in the month. The gap between Venus and Saturn increases to 3° on December 13th, around 5° on the 15th, and almost 11° by December 20th. Venus ends the month setting a wonderful 222/3 hours after the Sun, on its way to what will be an excellent apparition of Venus for observers at mid-northern latitudes in the opening months of 2019.

EARLY MORNING AND DAWN Mars rises less than 3 hours before the Sun as December opens but more than 3 hours before the Sun at month's (and year's) end. Mars brightens a bit — from magnitude 1.7 to 1.6 — this month, but its disk is only about 4″ wide. As December begins, Mars is almost 20° high in the east-southeast at mid-twilight and shines about halfway between high Spica and low Mercury. As the month ends, the Red Planet is still in Libra, but is nearing the head of Scorpius. Mercury was at greatest western elongation on November 28th but con-tinues with a fi ne morning apparition into the opening weeks of December. Mercury is bright, at magnitude –0.6, but its rise-time gets rapidly later. As December starts, the hot little world rises about 1½ hours before the Sun but by the 16th only about an hour. December 16th is also the day that Mercury, in Scorpius, is 5° northeast of 1st-magnitude Antares, though the red supergiant will be hard to see in the morning twilight. After Decem-ber 17th, Mercury will be too low in bright twilight to see. SUN AND MOON The Sun reaches the December solstice at 11:19 p.m. EST on December 21st. This is the shortest day and the begin-ning of winter in the Northern Hemi-sphere and the longest day and the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. The Sun undergoes an annular eclipse visible from the Middle East, India, and Indonesia, with partial phases visible from most of Asia, north-ern and western Australia, and parts of the Pacifi c (see page 49 for more infor-mation on this event). The Moon is full on December 12th, largely washing out the peak of the Geminid meteor shower the next few nights (but see page 48). On Decem-ber 22nd the waning lunar crescent is some 8° to 9° above Mars, the next morning 5° to 6° lower left of it. On December 24th, low in the southeast about 45 minutes before sunrise, a very thin Moon is several degrees left or upper left of Antares. On December 27th the very thin waxing Moon is about 5° upper left of Saturn, which may be hard to fi nd in bright evening twilight. On the next evening, Decem-ber 28th, the lunar crescent is spectac-ularly close to Venus, a bit more than 2° below the planet. ¢ FRED SCHAAF teaches astronomy at both Rowan University and Rowan College in Gloucester County, southern New Jersey.

In 2017 the Geminids put on a great show (see above), with little or no interference from the Moon. The International Meteor Organization calculated the zenithal hourly rate to be 136 that year. (That's the number of meteors a keen-eyed observer could spot under a very dark sky with the shower radiant at the zenith.) Moonlight will hide the faintest Geminid meteors in 2019, but there are still many ways to enjoy this wonderful event. T he year 2019 hasn't been great for major meteor showers. January's Qua-drantids peaked during a dark window, but August's Perseids shared the sky with a waxing gibbous Moon. December's Geminids, considered by some to be the premier shower of the year, will also suffer from moonlight. The shower's maximum is predicted to fall around midday on December 14th in the Americas, less than two days after full Moon. The ideal viewing windows occur in the early morning and late evening of the 14th, but the fat (though waning) Moon shines near the shower's radiant at both times. All is not lost, however. In 2016, the Geminids shared the sky with a full Moon near perigee, yet visual observers recorded meteor counts as high as 147, accord-ing to the International Meteor Organization (IMO). More typical counts were in 48 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE DECEMBER 2019 OBSERVING Celestial Calendar by S. N.

That's not bad! If your sky is transparent, you could see more than 20 meteors per hour between midnight and 4 a.m., when the radiant is highest. The Geminids tend to be rich in bright meteors, which are often spectacular even under very bright skies. Turn your back to the Moon to protect your night vision; the Geminids can appear anywhere in the sky, so you needn't look toward Gemini. Since the radiant (near Castor) rises just ahead of the Moon on the 14th, consider going out in the early evening. You might be lucky enough to catch a few earthgrazers — slow, bright meteors that angle upward from the eastern horizon — before or as the Moon makes its appearance. The Geminids are intrinsically interesting thanks to their parent object. Unlike most meteor show-ers, which spring from dust and rock particles left behind by active comets, the Geminids are produced by the semi-dead "rock comet" 3200 Phaethon. Phaethon acts as if it's both an asteroid and a comet. Most of the time, it's inert like an aster-oid and loses very little material as it hurtles through the solar system. However, when it approaches the Sun, Phaethon behaves more like a comet. Its rocky surface responds to the intense solar heat (as great as 800°C / 1,500°F) by cracking, which releases enough material to produce a modest dust tail. Only one other object in the solar system has been observed to act in a similar manner. Despite being one of the most productive and reliable meteor show-ers, the Geminids remains a some-what underreported event, possibly because December is often cold and cloudy over much of the Northern Hemisphere. The IMO encourages observers to watch a few nights before and after the predicted maxi-mum, even under moonlit skies.

The event lasts more than three hours, from the moment the Moon fi rst brushes the Sun's face to when the Sun again appears perfectly round. For observers in western Asia and eastern Africa, the eclipse is already in progress as the Sun rises, with the fi nal partial phase wrap-ping up while the Sun is still low in the morning sky. South and Central Asia see the eclipse begin in early morning and end before or near noon local time. Those on the eastern end of the eclipse path see a partial eclipse in the after-noon. Some Pacifi c islanders should see the Sun drop below the horizon before the eclipse concludes. Observers situated along a nar-row track that runs from Saudi Arabia through the United Arab Emirates, Oman, southern India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the Philip-pines will see a special type of partial solar eclipse known as an annular, or ring, eclipse. Typically, when the Moon passes directly between the Sun and Earth, its umbra (shadow cone) reaches Earth's surface, with the Sun com-pletely hidden. We experience this as a total solar eclipse. But if the Moon is closer to apogee, and so slightly farther from us, when it passes between Earth and Sun, its disk appears smaller and doesn't cover the entire Sun. Instead, the Sun's chromosphere shows as a brilliant ring of fi re, blazing along the Moon's perimeter. Because the Sun isn't fully blocked during an annular eclipse (in this case it's just 97% hidden at maximum), observers need proper eye protection, even when the Moon is centered in front of the solar disk. Certifi ed eclipse glasses or a properly fi ltered telescope will provide excellent views of the action. Pinhole projectors and telescopic projection are also good options (see https://is.gd/SolarProjection). The duration of annularity depends on the observer's location along the central path of the eclipse. Greatest eclipse occurs over eastern Sumatra (Indonesia) at 05:18 UT; annularity lasts 3 minutes and 40 seconds for that spot. For more detailed information, visit https://is.gd/2019annular. Lunar eclipses often take place two weeks before or after a solar eclipse. This fi nal solar eclipse of 2019 is fol-lowed by a penumbral lunar eclipse on January 10, 2020.

You may be able to spot it low in the southwest at dusk through the 12th or so. Look for it to reappear in the dawn sky around January 12th. When Jupiter is observable, any telescope shows the four big Galilean moons, and binoculars usually show two or three. They orbit Jupiter at dif-ferent rates, changing positions along a straight line from our point of view on Earth. Use the diagram on the facing page to identify them by their relative positions on any given time and date. All of the December interactions between Jupiter and its satellites and their shadows are tabulated on the fac-ing page. Look for events timed shortly after sunset. Features on Jupiter appear closer to the central meridian than to the limb for 50 minutes before and after transit-ing.

The A-type main-sequence star 18 Aurigae is on the edge of naked-eye visibility, so the occultation should be obvi-ous through hand-held binoculars, though a telescope will provide a much better view. When Pandora passes in front of the star, their combined brightness will drop to Pandora's own magnitude of 11.1 for up to 6 or 7 seconds. A telescope at high magnifi cation should also show the asteroid sneaking up on the star, as well as a 12.5-magnitude companion just 4 arcseconds from the primary star. As its formal moniker suggests, Pandora was the 55th minor planet discov-ered by astronomers. George Mary Searle, observing from Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York, spotted Pandora on September 10, 1858. Typically, naming rights are awarded to the discoverer; however, in this case, credit for the offi cial name has been awarded to Blandina Dudley, benefactor of the observatory, who considered Pandora an accurate personifi cation of the tumultuous conditions in Albany, where the observatory's trustees were embroiled in battle with its director, Benjamin A. Gould. The occultation will occur around 11:49 p.m. EST December 6th in northern Florida, around 10:51 p.m. in southern Texas, and 9:52 p.m. MST in Baja California Sur.

Phenomena of Jupiter's Moons, December 2019 Every day, interesting events happen between Jupiter's satellites and the planet's disk or shadow. The fi rst columns give the date and mid-time of the event, in Universal Time (which is 4 hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time). Next is the satellite involved: I for Io, II Europa, III Ganymede, or IV Callisto. Next is the type of event: Oc for an occultation of the satellite behind Jupiter's limb, Ec for an eclipse by Jupiter's shadow, Tr for a transit across the planet's face, or Sh for the satellite casting its own shadow onto Jupiter. An occultation or eclipse begins when the satellite disappears (D) and ends when it reappears (R ). A transit or shadow passage begins at ingress (I) and ends at egress (E ). Each event is gradual, taking up to several minutes. Predictions courtesy IMCCE / Paris Observatory.

Is Lavoisier the only lunar crater named for a scientist who faced the guillotine? The brilliant French chemist famed for his recognition that oxygen is a chemical element, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was one of many nobles who lost their heads during the French Revo-lution. But the crater Lavoisier remains along the western limb of the Moon, ironically near von Braun, another noble who supported a deposed regime. These two craters are so near the limb (about 80°W longitude) that they appear as foreshortened ellipses and are rarely observed. Yet the larger craters Gauss and Humboldt are both near 80°E longitude and frequently targeted by observers. The latter two craters are twice as big as Lavoisier and von Braun, and are readily observed in early evenings, while the western limb craters are best seen from full Moon until almost new Moon, progressively later in the night and early in morning. But there are other possible explanations for the slight. Most observers may not real-ize how interesting these noble craters are and thus haven't tried to fi nd them. The Lavoisier region is just inland from the western reaches of Oceanus Procellarum. Two 20- to 30-km-wide craters on this vast mare, Harding and N A S A / G S F C / A R IZ O N A S T A T E U N IV E R S IT Y Lavoisier A, are conspicuous markers to the area of interest just to their west. The group contains fi ve main craters of interest. The largest is Lavoisier, a roughly 70-km-wide, 600-meter-deep degraded crater bearing many clas-sic features of a fl oor-fractured crater. Lavoisier's fl oor contains a concentric inner ridge, concentric rilles, and an annular swath of mare lava, as well as a small but beautiful concentric crater. Von Braun is next biggest at 60 km diameter and 1.6 km deep. Less degraded than Lavoisier, von Braun's rim is best seen just before full Moon. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter QuickMap (https://is.gd/SM5NY1) shows that von Braun has a domed central fl oor elevated by about 300 m. The eastern half of the fl oor is smooth but not dark, while the western fl oor is sliced by eight non-concentric rilles. Next is 51 km Lavoisier E, another classic fl oor-fractured crater with a high eastern rim that abuts von Braun. It contains a broad wreath of concentric rilles circling a lava-fl ooded inner fl oor surrounding a central peak. The mare patch is visible in mid-sized telescopes.

The center of the crater fl oor is higher than the rim facing Ocea-nus Procellarum. The last concentric crater in the group is Lavoisier B, a relatively normal crater at fi rst glance — at 25 km it's almost a larger morphological twin of 16-km-wide Bessel — but its western side is wreathed in concentric rilles. Located right between the two main craters, Lavoisier B is distinctly visible because its eastern rim is bright when the lunar phase is waning — even appearing as a complete bright ring at high Sun illumination. This group of fl oor-fractured craters might seem exceptional, but such craters occur frequently along the western edge of Oceanus Procellarum, from Damoiseau at 4°S to Repsold at 51°N. Elsewhere on the Moon, fl oor-fractured craters almost always occur near impact-basin margins, where deep crustal fractures provide conduits for magma to rise and push crater fl oors up, creating concentric ridges and rilles, and often leaking onto the surface as lava fl ows and pyroclastic deposits. Oceanus Procellarum itself does not fi ll a recognized impact basin. How-ever, in 1981 Ewen Whitaker proposed a controversial basin boundary defi ned by Procellarum's semi-circular western shoreline (S&T: Sep. 2005, p. 63). This putative basin would be huge — 3,200 km wide — underlying Oceanus Procel-larum, Mare Imbrium, Mare Nubium, and Mare Serenitatis. Its existence has been neither convincingly confi rmed nor refuted, though most lunar scientists don't support it. However, the occur-rence of so many fl oor-fractured craters along Procellarum's shoreline adds another morphologic piece of evidence consistent with a long arc of deep fractures, as would be expected under a basin rim. Additionally, recently discov-ered long gravity highs (S&T: Dec. 2018, p. 52) coincide with Whitaker's proposed Procellarum edges, and the thorium-rich, radioactive Procellarum KREEP Ter-rane (S&T: Oct. 2018, p. 52), the source of most lunar volcanism, lies within it. For the terrestrial observer, the Lavoisier group is hard to study even though it is theoretically visible every lunation from full to almost new Moon. Yet only the dark annular ring of Lavoisier and the dark inner fl oor of Lavoisier E appear to be visible from Earth during average libration angles. Perhaps a lunar-imaging pro with a large scope and 5° to 8° of favor-able libration can begin to reveal this neglected area of the Moon. Oh, the answer to the question at the beginning of this article is "no." In addition to Lavoisier, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly also lost his head during the French Revolution's Reign of Terror and is honored with a large crater bearing his name on the southeastern limb. At least they have an eternal home on the Moon. ¢ Contributing Editor CHUCK WOOD often explores the lunar limb hunting for overlooked treasures. von Braun Lavoisier E B H This image captured August 6, 2010, just a few days before new Moon , hints at the rich features that await patient observers and imagers with moderately large-aperture telescopes.

A lthough Pisces, the Fishes, fl oats ever so duskly upon the sky, rural stargazers can swiftly espy the constellation's western fi sh. It swims beneath the Great Square of Pegasus and includes the asterism known as the Circlet of Pisces. But the eastern fi sh presents no distinctive pattern and glimmers more feebly as it nudges Andromeda's waist. Though lacking bright guide stars, its celestial waters serve up many deep-sky wonders. Let's work our way toward the eastern fi sh by starting in the ribbon of stars that joins the Fishes together. Our springboard will be the pretty double star Zeta (ζ) Piscium. My 4.1-inch (105-mm) refractor at 17× reveals a white, 5th-magnitude primary cozied up to a yellow, 6th-magnitude companion east-northeast. The galaxy NGC 524 is 3.4° north-east of Zeta. Trying to hide in a patch of 9th- to 12th-magnitude stars, it's pMessier 74 is by far the most photogenic galaxy in Pisces. Its spiral arms are stunning in this NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, but they can be hard to discern through the eyepiece of a backyard telescope. nonetheless easy to spot through my little refractor at 47×. There's a fi lled-in wedge of stars east of the galaxy and a more haphazard scattering near it and to the west. A wide, yellow-white and orange star pair sits off the south-western edge of the group. NGC 524 is small, round, intensifi es toward the center, and has an 11th-magnitude star near its southern edge. At 87× two more stars are visible north-northeast and southeast of the galaxy. They join the fi rst to make an isosceles triangle, with NGC 524 occupying much of its western side. The galaxy grows sharply brighter toward a tiny nucleus. In my 10-inch refl ector at 115×, NGC 524 spans about 2.5′ and holds a faint star at its east-southeastern edge. It sits in a westward-pointing V of fi ve dimmer galaxies that would share the fi eld of view, but I see only three little smudges at this magnifi cation.

Four stars, magnitude 10 to 13, form a tangent to the galaxy that slopes east-northeast. The line's second-brightest star touches the galaxy's south-southeastern edge.

In my 4.1-inch scope at 87×, the galaxy is a faint, 2′-long streak tipped a little west of north. There's an 11th-magnitude star 5′ east-southeast and a fainter star a bit closer and a shade east of north. Through my 10-inch scope at 216×, NGC 676 brightens near the core, and a dim star is intermittently visible just off the galaxy's side, approximately east of center. Alpha (α) Piscium marks the bend in the ribbon connecting the Fishes. It consists of a pair of white stars, magni-tudes 4.1 and 5.2, only 1.8″ apart. My little refractor at 122× splits this pair by a hair's breadth, showing the compan-ion west of its primary. An 8.1-magni-tude orange star lies 14′ west, and I see slightly fainter, yellow stars 6.7′ east-northeast and 7.2′ north-northwest. The three form a straight line, and the last two are listed as components C and D in the Washington Double Star Catalog, though they are probably not physical members of the star system. The only Messier object in Pisces is the galaxy M74. Because it lies only 1.3° east-northeast of Eta (η) Piscium and has a total magnitude of 9.4, novices often expect that M74 will be easy to spot. Not so! The galaxy's light is spread over a comparatively large area of the sky, so its surface bright-ness is low. Keep your eyes peeled for a sizeable ghostly glow. Having seen M74 many times, I no longer fi nd its phantom fuzz diffi cult to nab from my semirural home. My 4.1-inch refractor at 17× reveals a faint halo enfolding a relatively large, brighter core. At 47× I see a faint star at M74's eastern edge, which puts the galaxy's apparent size at 8′.

With my 10-inch scope at 213× I can make out a second spiral arm oppos-ing the fi rst. M74's halo is slightly oval north-south and grows progressively brighter toward the center. The heart of the core is a very short bar with the same orientation, but the arms spiral-ing into the core make it look elon-gated east-west farther out. Two nearly parallel lines of three stars each cut through the outer reaches of M74 west and northeast. A two-star line closer to the galaxy's center parallels the latter, its northern star placed squarely on a spiral arm. According to some pictorial atlases, we reached the tail of the eastern fi sh at Eta Piscium, but others show it begin-ning at Rho (ρ) or Chi (χ). In any case, the multiple stars Psi1 (ψ1) and Phi (φ) are well within the fi sh's domain. Through my little refractor at 17×, Psi1 shows as a pair of white, 5th-magnitude stars with the companion wide to the south-southeast of its primary. The 11th-magnitude third component is three times as distant to the east-southeast. At 68× Phi displays a 5th-magnitude deep-yellow star with a 9th-magnitude companion, perhaps reddish, nestled closely against it to the southwest.

It's named the HD 4798 Group after its brightest star, but Douglas likes to call it the Flying Wing. Look for it 40′ north of 65 Piscium. Through my 4.1-inch scope at 47×, I see seven stars outlin-ing a southward-pointing triangle. The "wing" spans 5.6′ tip to tip and is com-posed of stars ranging from magnitude 7.2 to 12.8, with the namesake star boasting a deep yellow hue. In light-pol-luted skies you may need a larger scope to see the dimmest star, which marks the western wingtip. Our fi nal target is the asterism Renou 18, named after Alexandre Renou, who wrote for the French journal Astronomie Magazine. It lies in the eastern fi sh 37′ east of Tau (τ) Piscium and marks the eastern point of a 20′ triangle formed with two yellow stars, magnitudes 6.2 and 6.7. I can see about 25 stars scattered across 18′ in my little refractor, but it's the view in my 10-inch scope that catches my imagination. Half the stars are gathered into a shape that strongly reminds me of the S shape in the iconic emblem of the fi ctional character Superman.

Advanced observers will also appreciate the remainder of this book, and, in fact, it would be a mistake to think it isn't useful for imagers. Each chapter focuses on a specifi c constellation with annotated charts, photographs, or sketches of each object. The observing notes are rich, not tedious, and frequently show how the target will look through dif-ferent instruments: 8×50 binoculars, 8- to 10-inch scopes at 100×, or 12- to 14-inch scopes at 125×, for example.

FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES, most of my astronomical observations have been made with a camera rather than an eyepiece. Recently, I've been making a concerted effort to return to visual observing, and perhaps even take it a bit more seriously than I had in the past. Volume 4 of The Night Sky Observ-er's Guide, which bears the subtitle The Glories of the Milky Way to –54°, has been a wonderful resource on this jour-ney. This book was my introduction to the series, and I was so impressed by it that I purchased the fi rst two volumes, which cover the whole sky for Northern Hemisphere observers, as well. (Volume 3 addresses the southern skies.) Volume 4 easily stands on its own, apart from the rest of the series. There's some overlap with the content of previ-ous volumes in the objects covered, but here the author, George Robert Kepple, focuses more intently on the Milky Way region. He's added more than 1,000 new objects not previously covered, including E. E. Barnard's entire Catalogue of Dark Markings of the Sky, a great many planetary nebulae, the van den Berg refl ection nebulae, and Beverly Lynds' Catalogue of Dark Nebulae. More than 800 objects listed in the earlier volumes were also updated with new notes and/or photographs. I found the fi rst chapter to be a sat-isfying refresher and primer on visual observing basics. It covers the character-istics and nature of the different kinds of astronomical targets, conventions for making observing logs, and some advice on record keeping, sketching, eyepiece usage, and so on. This book is an excel-be accessible even with modest optics at moder-ately light-polluted loca-tions are included in th e target list. I've seen my share of observing guides for which the images were reaped from an old set of photographic plates, typically with large areas completely blown out or saturated. As an imager, I was pleased with the high-quality photographs and sketches provided for all of the discussed objects. In fact, just leafi ng through the book, I've discov-ered many dozens of new targets that I want to photograph . . . I mean . . . observe with my Dobsonian. ¢ RICHARD S.

A few years ago, it was said that the sum total of human knowl-edge doubled every fi ve years, but today it seems more like exponential growth. Take terms like exoplanet and exobiology or, more commonly now, astrobiology. All were coined decades ago but remained largely theoretical, or "sciences without subject matter," until recently. Exoplanets now prompt some of the most exciting studies in astronomy, and astrobiology has become a driving force of modern space exploration. How does this compare to our state of knowledge at the turn of the 20th century? What could the interested public know about the universe in the early 1900s? Much insight is provided by such contemporary publications as L'Astronomie, a popular French astronomy review published from 1883 to 1894 and edited by prolifi c author Camille Flammarion; Astronomy for Everybody, penned in 1902 by Simon New-comb, the just-retired director of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, and aimed at a non-expert audience; and lastly, the 1906 edition of A New Astronomy, a textbook by David Todd, professor of astronomy and director of the Amherst College Observatory in Amherst, Massachusetts. All three authors were devoted astronomers and science popular-izers, and their texts are good indicators of the ideas and theo-ries that moved from academic science into the popular realm. Before proceeding, we must consider the state of 19th-century scientifi c knowledge, as well as the technological advances of the time. Most astronomical work was done visu-ally and was devoted to solar system and positional astron-omy, time keeping for naval and transportation purposes, and establishing precise ephemerides.

Moreover, power-ful new tools like spectroscopy and photography were just beginning to hit the scene. Of the 333 pages in Newcomb's Astronomy for Everybody, nearly 200 were devoted to the solar system, while some 40 covered such basics as time, longitude, the celestial sphere, and the seasons. An additional 40 or so pages fell under the heading "The Fixed Stars." Just six pages dealt with cosmology. Similarly, of Todd's A New Astronomy's 480 pages, only the last 50 (excluding the index) covered subjects beyond navigation and the solar system in a chapter titled "The Stars and the Cosmogony." In an 1887 speech that was reprinted in the January and February 1888 issues of The Sidereal Messenger, Newcomb confessed that so far as astronomy was concerned, "we do appear to be fast reaching the limits of our knowledge." Yet by 1902, when he addressed the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America, he made clear that his views had changed. "What lies before us is an illimitable fi eld," he averred, "the existence of which was scarcely suspected ten years ago. . . ." Perhaps astronomical knowledge was not so bounded after all! What Fuels the Sun? What was known about the physics of our Sun at the open-ing of the 20th century? Not a lot, it would seem. Beyond its overall dimensions and evident surface features, virtually nothing was known of our star's real age and inner workings. Flammarion, Todd, and Newcomb all dealt expansively with visible solar phenomena, especially sunspot frequency, size, and shape, in their public writings. For instance, issue No. 4 in 1894 of L'Astronomie featured many beautiful lithographs of major sunspots, as well as a paper on the physical proper-ties of the Sun that detailed its rotational aspects and what sunspots might tell us about the solar interior. Since features like prominences and the corona were only visible during relatively rare total eclipses, not much was known of them, and based on early spectroscopic data, Newcomb described them as ". . . large masses of incandescent vapour burst forth from every part of the Sun." The fundamentals of nuclear fusion wouldn't become clear until the 1920s and 1930s when Arthur Eddington suggested, and later Hans Bethe and others showed, that the Sun's main source of energy involved the fusion of hydrogen to helium. Prior to that, vague theories of meteoric impacts, solar contraction, and heat output were proposed, which, if true, would make the Sun at most a few million years old, something most scientists knew couldn't be the case. As Todd noted, "Only one possible explanation remains; if the Sun is contracting upon himself [sic], no matter how slowly, gases composing his volume must generate heat in this process. The eminent German physicist, von Helmholtz fi rst proposed this theory of maintenance about 1850, and it is now universally accepted." Agreeing that the Sun's heat was maintained by uniform contraction, Todd speculated that the Sun, then thought to be about 20 million years old, would've shrunk to half its present diameter in 5 million years and "might con-tinue to emit heat suffi cient to maintain certain types of life on our earth" for an additional 5 million years. He fi gured the solar system life expectancy at 30 to 40 million years.

The origin and nature of lunar craters was a long-standing mystery for astronomers and wasn't fully resolved until the 1960s when geologist and planetary scientist Gene Shoemaker showed defi nitively that most craters were due to meteoric impacts. Prior to that, consensus was that lunar craters were volcanic in origin. As Newcomb stated, "There is an almost exact resemblance between them and the craters of our great volcanoes." This point of view stemmed in large measure from the "fountain model" of volcanic eruptions on the Moon proposed by James Nasmyth and James Carpenter in 1874 and illustrated by their magnifi cent if fanciful plaster-of-Paris models of the lunar surface in their book The Moon: Consid-ered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite. Comparing Nasmyth and Carpenter's models of lunar "volcanoes" with the Vesuvius region of Italy, Todd stated unequivocally that the volcanic origins of both sites were "self-evident." In describing the prominent lunar crater Tycho and its extensive system of ejecta rays, Newcomb also opined that it appeared "as if the moon had been cracked and the cracks fi lled with melted white matter." It would be decades before defi nitive evidence shattered the volcanic theory of lunar crater formation. Shrouded Venus Much early discussion centered on the rotation periods of both Mercury and Venus and the illusive appearance of their respective visible features. Todd had a longstanding interest in Venus in particular. Indeed, he was responsible for a size-able fraction of the approximately 1,380 measurable photo-graphic plates taken by U.S.-based expedition teams formed to observe the 1882 transit of Venus. Curiously, after sharing typical illustrations of "dull, indefi nite markings" on Venus with readers of A New Astronomy, Todd went on to emphasize "new" observations by Percival Lowell and Andrew Douglass of prominent radial streaks on Venus — all of which were later shown to be illusory. Newcomb also described his observations of the transit of Venus in Astronomy for Everybody, concluding that the planet's atmosphere is "so full of vapour that we cannot see the light of the Sun by direct refraction through it." Instead, we see "an illuminated stratum of clouds or vapour fl oating in an atmosphere. Such being the case, it is not at all likely that astronomers on Earth can ever see the solid body of the planet through these clouds." Finally, he dismissed reports of a putative Venusian moon, as well as occasional cla ims of a faint glow on the unilluminated portion of the planet's hemi-sphere at inferior conjunction, as an optical illusion. This latter phenomenon, also known as the ashen light, remains a point of contention to this day. pASTUTE OBSERVER Simon Newcomb was openly skeptical of Percival Lowell's claim that a canal network, constructed by intelligent beings, existed on Mars. Though he included Lowell's map of Mars with its supposed canals in Astronomy for Everybody, he also directed the reader to look attentively at the drawings of Mars made at Lick Observatory by W. W. Campbell (left) and W. J. Hussey (right) during the 1892 opposition. t POPULAR POPU-LARIZER Simon Newcomb became professor of as-tronomy at the U.S. Naval Observatory in 1861. Newcomb was a prolifi c writer and frequently penned popular astronomy columns for McClure's Magazine, some of which served as the basis for his 1902 book Astronomy for Everybody. "The reader will excuse me from saying anything about the possible inhabitants of Mars."

When they turned to Mars, all three authors had much to say. Since visual observing, principally with large refractors, was at its peak, speculation about Mars, its alleged canals, and possible inhabitants was at a fever pitch with the general public. This obsession was triggered in 1877, after cel-ebrated Italian astronomer Giovanni Schia-parelli reported seeing linear structures on the planet he termed "canali" (S&T: July 2018, p. 28). A perusal of virtually any 1894 issue of L'Astronomie, Flammarion's 1892 epic La planète Mars et ses conditions d'habilité, or Percival Lowell's 1906 book Mars and its Canals, provides a full sense of how widespread and hotly debated the canal issue was at the time. Like Lowell, Flammarion very much believed in the reality of the canals and that they were the work of intelli-gent beings. Similarly, Todd, while being more cautious about intelligent Martians, seemed fully on board with depictions of the extensive canal networks as artifi cial in nature, with the following caveat: "By only long continued observations . . . of Mars, can we hope for a rational solution of the question of life in another world than ours." In contrast, Newcomb took a totally analytical approach. After evaluating reports by numerous observers concern-ing the visibility and possible nature of the putative canals, he noted that renowned Lick Observatory astronomer E. E. Barnard, whom he described as "one of the most cautious observers," had studied Mars with "the largest and fi nest telescope in the world . . . under the best possible conditions," yet didn't draw features that "quite correspond[ed] to the channels of Schia-parelli and Lowell." Newcomb pointed out that "all recent observers are in agreement that, if Mars has any atmosphere at all, it is much rarer than our own and contains little or no aqueous vapour." In other words, there was nothing in Mars's atmosphere that would obscure Barnard's view of the planet's topography. If Barnard didn't see it — it wasn't there. As far as Lowell's presumed intelligent Martians were concerned, Newcomb acerbically concluded that "The reader will excuse me from saying anything about the possible inhabitants of Mars. [The reader] knows just as much on the subject as I do, and that is nothing at all." tASTRONOMER IN CHARGE David Peck Todd started his professional career at the U.S. Naval Ob-servatory in Washington, DC, but joined the faculty of Amherst College, Massachusetts, in 1881. Todd helped organize and led several eclipse expeditions and was head astronomer for observations of the 1882 transit of Venus from Lick Observatory. pOTHERWORLDLY OUTBREAKS Although Todd's discussion of the Sun's chromosphere and prominences centered on the use of the spectrohelio-graph to capture images on dry plates, he used lithographs by the noted French artist and astronomer Étienne Trouvelot to illustrate the discussion.DA V ID T O D D : L IB R A R Y O F C O N G R E S S , P R IN T S & P H O T O G R A P H S D IV IS IO N , L C -D IG -G G B A IN -0 1 2 6 6 ; S O L A R P R O M IN E N C E S : G E T T Y I M A G E S / S S P L What We Knew Then 64 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE Jupiter: A Small Sun? Jupiter's cloud features and its prominent satellites naturally received ample attention at the dawn of the 20th century, but only Newcomb showed much insight into the planet's inner workings, drawing comparisons between it and the Sun. He came to the conclusion that Jupiter could be a small Sun based on simple calculations that showed the planet's density must be much less than Earth's, in fact, "only about one third greater than the density of water," while its surface gravity was "between two and three times that at the surface of the earth." That is, greater compression due to gravity resulted in greater density. From this he concluded that Jupiter's "outer portions at least were composed of aeriform matter." Com-bining his argument on density with evidence of rotation, Newcomb suggested that Jupiter had "a greater or less resem-blance to the Sun in its physical constitution." On the whole, he viewed Jupiter as "a small sun of which the surface has cooled off till it no longer emits light." Newcomb would have prized brown dwarfs! Is the Milky Way All There Is? To illustrate the then-known extent of the universe, New-comb took the reader on an imaginary voyage from Earth to the "inconceivable" distance of 100,000 light-years. "So far as we know," he revealed, "we should at this point fi nd ourselves in utter darkness, a black and starless sky surrounding us on all sides. But, in one direction, we should see a large patch of feeble light spreading over a considerable part of the heavens like a faint cloud or the fi rst glimpse of dawn. Possibly, there might be other such patches in different directions, but of those we know nothing." Newcomb imagined the observer fl ying toward one of those light patches, watching as it spread over more and more of the sky with each passing moment. Interestingly, Newcomb's concept of the cosmos didn't extend much beyond William Herschel's 1785 depiction of the Milky Way, which was based on star counts and posi-tional measurements of clusters and nebulae, and Herschel's proposed position of the Sun. Oddly as well, Newcomb made no mention of "island universes" (galaxies), an idea pro-posed in the 18th century by philosopher Immanuel Kant, and instead described the Milky Way as ". . . a girdle appar-ently spanning the sky and perhaps, in reality, spanning the entire universe of stars, uniting them, as it were, into a single system, one stupendous whole." This collection of "millions of stars," some of which had bodies (planets) associated with them, comprised the knowable universe. In contrast to that of Newcomb, Todd's perspective was signifi cantly more developed, probably refl ecting the differ-ence in their ages. Newcomb was retired and approaching 70 at the turn of the 20th century while Todd was still in his mid-40s and an active scientist when he wrote A New Astronomy. Consequently, he used the term "galaxy" in reference to the Milky Way and clearly hinted that the Great Nebula in Andromeda was different from many of the other nebulae that had been cataloged by then. "Its spectrum shows that it is not gaseous," he wrote, yet "still no telescope has yet proved competent to resolve it." Keeping in mind that the term "universe" at the time referred only to what had been mapped of the Milky Way, which also was thought to encompass all stars and assorted pBAD BREAKOUT Flammarion regularly included dramatic sketches of large sunspots in L'Astronomie, including this one of the great spot of November 1893 as sketched by Théodore Moreaux of Bourges. uAIMING FOR VERACITY James Nasmyth took up astronomy after a successful career as a mechanical engineer. In 1874, he co-wrote The Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satel-lite with the professional astronomer James Carpenter. The pair illustrated their discussions with photographs of elaborate plaster-of-Paris models based on drawings that "were again and again repeated, revised, and compared with the actual objects" in an attempt to represent the lunar surface as accurately as possible.

Ask-ing what lies beyond, he stated that "outside the realm of fact, imagination alone can answer," and wondered, "Are, then, the inconceivable vastnesses of space tenanted with other universes than the one our telescopes unfold?" Technology: Refractors Rule Probably no chapter in Astronomy for Everybody shows more clearly how much things have changed in the past 100 or so years than the one titled "Astronomical Instruments." In 1902 refractors still reigned supreme even though it had become clear by then that the 40-inch Yerkes behe-moth would never be topped. In its day, building anything larger than a 40-inch was no doubt equivalent to producing 8-meter-class telescope mirrors today. There were several reasons for this, including the immense mechanical chal-lenges in supporting such an ungainly and heavy instrument, and the fact that a much larger objective would sag under the force of gravity, thereby distorting its fi nely confi gured shape. This was amply demonstrated by the Great Paris Exhibi-tion Telescope of 1900, which had a 49.2-inch (1.25-meter) diameter lens and had to be fi xed horizontally to overcome gravitational distortion. It was subsequently abandoned. Despite such clear limitations, Newcomb extolled the virtues of refractors and had little use for refl ectors. He called them "contrivances" and maintained (fairly enough) that "the great diffi culty in using a large mirror is that it bends under the infl uence of its own weight" when exceeding four feet in diameter, and therefore "[The] performance of refl ec-tors generally . . . has not corresponded to their size." Little did he realize that just a few years later the great 60-inch at Mount Wilson Observatory would lay all those objections to rest for good. It's also sobering to recall that beginning in 1905, just three years after Newcomb's book came out, Albert Einstein would publish a series of groundbreaking papers, including the one that detailed his special theory of relativity, which would shake the foundations of modern physics and forever change our views of space, time, and matter. Likewise, in the following decades, the refl ectors at Mount Wilson Observa-tory and Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia would revolutionize our understanding of the size of the universe and the nature of galaxies. Such a Short Time Can this brief retrospective on the status of astronomical knowledge at the turn of the 20th century provide some insight as to where we will be 100 years hence? Simon New-comb had some advice on that score as well, pointing out that "one of the greatest problems of astronomy is, when and how did this journey begin and when and how will it end? Before this question our science stands dumb." ¢ KLAUS BRASCH is professor emeritus of biology at Califor-nia State University, San Bernardino, and docent in the public program at Lowell Observatory.

Some amateurs may fi nd the results pleasantly surprising. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE NEW 10-inch f/12 classical Cassegrain from Taiwan-based Guan Sheng Optical (GSO for short) says 21st century. There's its carbon-fi ber truss-tube design, quartz optics, mirror coatings with 96% refl ectivity, cooling fans, and a dual-speed, 3¼-inch Crayford-style focuser for starters. But to understand where my head was at while testing the telescope we borrowed from Agena AstroProducts for this review, you need to turn the calendar back to a time well before the Apollo Moon landings and indulge me for a bit of nostalgia. Back then American amateur astronomy was very different from now. The big-aperture Dobsonian revolution and its emphasis on deep-sky observing wouldn't begin for more than another decade. The same was true for the astrophotography boom that followed the introduction of popularly priced Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. Owning a 6-inch Newtonian refl ector marked you as a serious amateur, and we usually spent our time at the eyepiece staring at the Moon, planets, a handful of double stars, and the brighter deep-sky objects culled mostly from the Messier catalog. Forget the internet, personal com-puters, smartphones, and social media fl ooding us with instantaneous astro-nomical information. Back then we got our astronomy fi x once a month when Sky & Telescope showed up in the mailbox — you know, the metal kind on a post out by the end of the driveway. As I'd walk from the mailbox to the house the world around me seemed to fade into the background as I pulled the magazine from its manila envelope and began fl ipping pages. The advertisements were as fascinat-ing as the articles. Those slick Unitron ads on the back cover were mesmer-izing since then, as now, refractors held a special place in the hearts of amateurs. Big refl ectors also captivated my imagination. And then there were the Cassegrain refl ectors. Most of the major telescope manufacturers offered them — Cave, Tinsley, and Optical Craftsman, to name a few. They were expensive, and that alone made them seem special. I'm sure I wasn't the only young amateur to dream about observ-ing with one. GSO 10-inch f/12 Classical Cassegrain U.S. Price: $2,795 agenaastro.com What We Like First-class mechanical construction Excellent optics A reminder that classic optical designs are still viable for amateur astronomy What We Don't Like While the focuser is very good for many visual and photographic applications, an upgrade would be desirable for some critical uses with heavy eyepieces and cameras. p GSO's 10-inch classical Cassegrain is a solidly built instrument that excels for viewing the Moon, planets, double stars, and many deep-sky objects. It does, however, require a solid mount to take advantage of its high-mag-nifi cation performance. 66 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE As the years passed, I learned a lot more about telescopes and observing than I knew then, but that didn't stop those early memories from surfacing as I unpacked the 10-inch GSO Casseg-rain. And the best part? It was a fantasy fulfi lled — the views through the scope surpassed what I'm sure I was imagin-ing back in the '60s, even with the now-critical eye of an experienced observer. What's Special About a Classical Cassegrain? Given the plethora of modern telescope designs, it's reasonable to ask if an opti-cal confi guration from the 17th century has anything special to offer today. The short answer is that for many visual observers and some types of astropho-tography it offers a lot. Like a Newto-nian, it has only two mirrors so it is highly effi cient at transmitting light, and it's 100% achromatic, focusing all wavelengths from ultraviolet through infrared to a single point. There's no need to tweak the focus when using different color fi lters, either for visual observing or astrophotography. There's also no front corrector plate that can dew up, and for many of us that's a huge plus. The scope's f/12 focal ratio is very forgiving of eyepiece designs. One stop on my trip down memory lane involved digging out a couple of 1963-vintage Edscorp Orthoscopic eyepieces from Edmund Scientifi c. They performed beautifully with the scope even though they can't come close to competing with modern designs that have larger appar-ent fi elds, which translate into larger true fi elds of view for a given magnifi ca-tion on any telescope. It shouldn't be necessary to remind readers today, but it's still worth repeating that a telescope's f/number only affects the brightness of extended objects (think anything other than stars) focused onto an imaging detector. Stars appear the same brightness visu-ally in any 10-inch telescope regardless of its f/number. And likewise, extended objects appear the same brightness for any 10-inch telescope regardless of its f/ number as long as you are viewing with the same magnifi cation. Notes on Using the Scope The GSO 10-inch classical Cassegrain is a fi rst-class instrument. The optics proved to be excellent. They were perfectly collimated out of the box (Agena AstroProducts says it checks every telescope optically before it's shipped.) Images would snap into focus the moment you hit the sweet spot when focusing an eyepiece. The scope's mechanics are well designed and manu-s k ya nd te l e scope .com • D EC E M B E R 2 019 67 q Left: More so than with some optical designs, a Cassegrain's performance is sensitive to optical collimation. The scope was perfectly collimated out of the box, in part thanks to its rigid secondary-mirror assembly. Right: Well-made light baffl es keep extraneous sky light from the scope's focal plane on axis, but a small annulus of light around the secondary mirror can reach the edge of some 2-inch eyepieces. It did not present a problem during the author's visual and photographic testing. factured. But there are some things to consider when it comes to using this scope. Foremost is its relatively long focal length of 120 inches (3,048 mil-limeters), which, for visual use, makes it a high-magnifi cation telescope. For example, I typically do low-power observing with a Tele Vue 35-mm Panoptic eyepiece, which on this scope yields a substantial 87× and a true fi eld about ¾° wide — big enough to show the entire Moon, but still too small for some splashy open star clusters and showpiece nebulae and galaxies. The maximum fi eld possible with a 2-inch eyepiece (limited by its barrel diameter) is only 53 arcminutes. For the other end of the magnifi ca-tion spectrum, I used a Tele Vue 3.7-mm Ethos eyepiece yielding 824× and an 8-arcminute fi eld. That's beyond the oft-recommended top magnifi cation of 75× per inch of telescope aperture, and it's a testament to the scope's fi ne optics. I resorted to this seemingly ridiculous magnifi cation when split-ting some of the challenging double stars listed in Phillip Kane's article on fi nding a telescope's Dawes limit (S&T: September 2016, p.30). For the record, the scope easily split SST 359 in Her-cules with a separation of 0.75 arcsec-ond, so I have little doubt that under good observing conditions it would S&T Test Report 68 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE split doubles at its Dawes limit of 0.46 arcsecond even though poor seeing and clouds foiled my attempts to prove that by observing 51 Aquarii. The basic scope weighs 38 pounds (17 kg), and a fi nder, star diagonal, and eyepiece add a couple more. As such, it needs a solid mount, and I found it a good match for my 12-year-old Astro-Physics Mach 1 German equatorial. But here's the rub. For last January's lunar eclipse I put that mount on a temporary aluminum pier made from 5-inch elec-trical conduit. It was fi ne for the small scopes used for the eclipse but totally inadequate for the 10-inch Cassegrain. High-magnifi cation views jiggled like a bowl of Jell-O. I had to switch the Mach 1 to a permanent pier made from a scavenged steel streetlight pole 8 inches in diameter. It simply drives home the point that you need a very solid sup-port to enjoy using this scope at high magnifi cation. There are two Losmandy-style dovetail mounting bars on the GSO scope. Equipped for typical observing or photography, the scope's balance point falls near the center of these dovetails, but be aware that the bars are only 10 inches long. When the scope was bal-anced in the long saddle of my Mach 1 mount, neither of the saddle's two clamps would engage the scope's dove-tail bar. This might not be a problem for short saddles or ones with three or more clamps, but I had to mount my own long dovetail bar to the scope to make it work with my setup. The scope's focus falls a generous 9½ inches (about 240 mm) outside the rear cell. The tip/tilt adjustable mounting base for the focuser consumes 1½ inches of this back focus, and the focuser another 3½ inches, but that still leaves plenty of space for a complex camera setup with a fi lter wheel and off-axis guider. The scope comes with three extension tubes (a pair 1 inch long and one 2 inches long), giving you a huge amount of fl exibility in positioning the focuser the right distance from the rear cell for various visual and imaging setups. The downside is that the focuser has only 2 inches of travel. This was adequate for most of my eyepieces and a star diagonal without using extension tubes. But adding a Barlow lens often meant having to add one of the exten-sions — a bit of an inconvenience. For much of my observing the dual-speed focuser was fi ne. But some of my heavier eyepieces required putting a fair amount of tension on the focuser's drive shaft to keep it from slipping, and that made the fi ne-focus knob feel spongy and even slip at times. It wasn't a show-stopper, but for critical high-magnifi -cation observing with heavy eyepieces it would be nice to have the precision control that a quality rack-and-pinion focuser offers. The same goes for imag-ing with heavy camera setups. Photographic Performance Speaking of imaging, this classical Cassegrain is superb for lunar and planetary work, but for wide-fi eld deep-sky photography, it has limita-tions that go beyond its relatively slow f/number. Even at the edge of the 40-arcminute-wide fi eld captured by a full-frame DSLR camera, stars showed the noticeable effects of a Cassegrain's inherent coma. There are more reasons than just faster f/numbers that make modern optical designs preferred by today's deep-sky photographers work-ing with large-format cameras. Even so, as the images here prove, for some of the smaller and brighter deep-sky objects, especially open and globular star clusters, the 10-inch GSO Casseg-rain does a great job. Had I shown up at t Far left: The mounting base for the focuser has tip/tilt adjustments to aid with precision collimation and squaring equipment to the scope's optical axis. A trio of small fans powered by a supplied battery holder for eight AA batteries helps acclimate the primary mirror to ambi-ent air temperature.

I would have been fl abbergasted too, and to prove that point to myself I made the images with a DSLR set to ISO 400 — homage to the cameras and Kodak Tri-X fi lm that was state of the art back then. Observing Impressions This is a hardware review and not an observing article, so I can't take a lot of space to wax poetic about the time I spent observing with the GSO Casseg-rain. But it was a lot of fun. On several sultry nights last summer, armed with Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas, I tracked down hundreds of targets along the Milky Way from Sagittarius to Cassiopeia. My light-polluted sky took its toll on faint nebulae, but many double stars and star clusters were simply beautiful at magnifi cations of about 150×, showing subtle star hues with unusual purity. Bumping the magnifi ca-tion up to 305× with a Tele Vue 10-mm Delos eyepiece made easy work of distin-guishing many tiny planetary nebulae from surrounding stars — something that isn't as easy using the same eyepiece on my 12-inch f/5 Dobsonian, because the magnifi cation is barely half that of the 10-inch Cassegrain. From my backyard observatory this past summer, Jupiter and Saturn were only visible as they skimmed the treetops after dusk when the heat of the day was still shimmering up from the foliage. As such, the seeing was poor, but there were still moments when the views were excellent. Those and the success I had observing the Moon in a higher sky make it clear to me that the scope is a superb planetary instrument. For the types of observing and imaging mentioned above, I can highly recommend the 10-inch GSO classical Cassegrain. There are other choices for wide-fi eld observing and astrophotogra-phy, but in many respects those instru-ments can't compete with a Cassegrain when it comes to the Moon, planets, double stars, and star clusters that have been hallmarks of observers for several hundred years. For these objects a clas-sical Cassegrain really does excel. ■ One reason DENNIS DI CICCO fi nds astronomical nostalgia intoxicating is because observing the night sky remains every bit as exciting now as it was when he was a teenager. u The scope is a superb instrument visually and photographically for the Moon and plan-ets.

PRACTICALLY ALL AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS are familiar with the term "hobby killer" (see my article on page 36). Those cheap little scopes on wobbly equatorial mounts have dimmed the enthusiasm of countless beginners for decades, yet manufacturers keep spewing them out, especially around the December holiday shopping season. Come January, thousands of people are shivering out in the cold, wondering if something is wrong with them because they just can't get that &@#! thing to work. The scope goes in a closet, the would-be astronomer goes into model railroading, and years later your astronomy club gets the remains (usu-ally missing parts) as a donation. Sometimes the whole setup is a pile of poo. In that case, it's best used as a boat anchor. (Hey, at least the counter-A L L P H O T O S B Y T H E A U T H O R 72 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE weight is useful!) But often the scope itself is okay; it's just the mount that, shall we say, disappoints. Fortunately, turning an equatorially mounted Newtonian into a Dobsonian is a piece of cake. First build a wooden box to go around the tube. Make its inside dimen-sions 11/8″ larger than the tube so you can put a little padding in there, just enough to hold the tube snug but loose enough to let you move it up and down to fi ne-tune its balance. Find something round to use for the altitude bearings. I like pipe end caps. The 5″ black ones work well. I cut them down so they only stick out an inch or so. Sand the back fl at so they fi t tight against the box. The rocker box is just three upright boards, the two on either side hold-ing the scope tube box and the third one providing support for the other two. Make this middle piece 1/8″ to ¼″ wider than your tube box so the tube box will move inside the rocker box without scraping. Be sure the center piece is short enough to let your scope reach the horizon, and also ensure the whole works is tall enough for the back of the scope to clear the center bolt at the bottom when the scope is balanced with the heaviest eyepiece you expect to use. (The bottom of the scope will get closer to that bolt when you rebalance.) You also want it tall enough to put the eyepiece at a comfortable height, so don't be shy here. A few extra inches of clearance at the bottom won't hurt. You can cut notches or circles for the altitude bearings to rest in. With a light scope, Tefl on is usually too slick against the pipe-cap bearing, so I prefer thick felt instead. A curved cutout will let you position the felt for optimum friction — the higher up around the curve you put the felt, the tighter it holds the scope. With V-shaped notches, the angle of the V determines where the felt rests. The base needs to be wide enough to be stable. For a typical 4″ to 4½″ f/10 q Left: Despite its sturdy appearance, this mount was way undersized for the scope, which had pretty decent optics . Right: The same Edmund scope on a Dobsonian mount.

You'll need one circle for the base of the rocker box and either another circle or a triangle for the ground board. Cover the bottom of the circle with Formica. Wilson Arts stopped mak-ing the popular Ebony Star that Dob-builders have been using for years, but Formica brand 909-42 Crystal Finish is emerging as a worthy successor. Put three Tefl on pads on the ground board, facing the Formica. Install the feet directly beneath the Tefl on pads. Run a bolt upward through the center of the ground board and rocker box, mak-ing it a snug but not tight fi t. Use a stop nut to keep from overtightening the bolt. Take everything apart, paint it, then put it back together again and use it!

I lived by that mindset that summer. On the round-trip bus commute to and from campus, I dove into various astrophys-ics texts and tuned into astronomy podcasts. I studied software packages and Python libraries at home, devouring papers relevant to my project. I walked into the lab with questions and left with new ones. In January 2018, I got the chance to present my work with fellow intern Rishi Dange at the American Astronom-ical Society's 233rd meeting in Seattle, Washington. It was thrilling to see our humble contributions to research being recognized. At the convention center, I met astrophysicists and astronomers of all backgrounds and interests. At An Astral Epiphany For this teenager, a visit to Lick Observatory kindled a fascination with the cosmos and the community that studies it. I PEERED THROUGH THE BACK window of the van making its way up the winding road to Mount Hamilton, home of the iconic Lick Observatory. Looking down, I could see the city lights below, but as I glanced up, the view graduated into an unadulterated pan-orama of the sky awash with stars. That warm summer night, my love for astronomy was awakened — my intellectual self burned with curiosity, my spiritual self felt awestruck. Crazy as it sounds, that was the fi rst time in my 16 years that I'd really seen the night sky. I've traveled a cosmic path ever since. This eye-opening visit took place after my sophomore year of high school, when I had the good fortune to work with researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz as a summer intern. I'd applied to the Science Intern-ship Program, which matches high schoolers with research projects based on their strengths and interests. I was one of two interns assisting my mentor, Clayton Strawn, a graduate student of physics professor Joel Primack. For the next ten weeks, we tackled multiple projects simultaneously, but our primary goal focused on developing a software tool that can help astrophys-icists study metals in the circumgalactic medium (the diffuse, nearly invisible gas that surrounds the disks of galaxies). In principle, researchers can use our soft-ware, combined with absorption line spectroscopy, to map the abundance of ions across the circumgalactic medium. During my internship, I soaked up a lot of material not found in your typical high school classroom, from the importance of a Lyman-alpha forest to how an adaptive mesh refi nement code works! More importantly, I got a sense of what it's like to be a working scien-tist, and I liked it — a lot. discussion panels and keynote speeches, I grasped these scientists' deep com-mitment to learning, collaboration, and discovery. When I discussed our research with academics or engineers, I felt that shared curiosity for the cosmos and its unfathomable mysteries. As I prepare to head off to college next year, I'm not sure how astro-physics and astronomy will play out in the grand scheme of my academic aspirations. But that drive up to Lick Observatory two summers ago certainly triggered what has become a passionate enchantment with the subject as well as a strong attachment to the devoted community behind it. ¢ BRYAN WANG is a senior at the Harker School in San Jose, California. Besides pursuing research in astrophys-ics, he runs the school's programming club and a six-person jazz combo. 84 D EC E M B E R 2 019 • S K Y & TELESCO PE q A night drive up to Lick Observatory at age 16 opened entirely new vistas for the author.

Every SVX model comes with its unique Zygo test report measuring the objective at full aperture. The smooth and stable 2.5" focuser has 1.25" and 2" adapters for visual use and a .8X reducer/flattener is included for wide-field, deep-sky imaging at 336 mm f-4.8! Also included are heavy-duty hinged dual mounting rings and our C20 thickly padded travel case. Every SVX70T is checked with its .8 reducer to ensure the optical system maintains its alignment through rotation. Pictured above are the optional risers and Losmandy-style rail. We invented risers in order to attain balance when imaging with small, lightweight refractors. The risers and long rail leave room for the camera and permit the telescope to be moved forward to attain proper balance. Stellarvue DSSP, Likely, CA. Image © Tony Hallas
