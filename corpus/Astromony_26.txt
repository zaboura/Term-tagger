Essays on the Motion of Celestial Bodies -
Knowing some of the most oft-used astronomy terms will help you better understand the nuts and bolts of stargazing and the science of astronomy. What's the difference between a reflector and a refractor? Whether you're choosing a telescope, deep in the pages of , or planning your trip to the next big celestial event, the astronomy glossary below will get you up-to-speed on the essentials. A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Angular Size and Distance The apparent size of an object in the sky, or the distance between two objects, measured as an angle. Your index finger held at arm's length spans about 1°, your fist about 10°. Aperture The diameter of a telescope's main lens or mirror — and the scope's most important attribute. As a rule of thumb, a telescope's maximum useful magnification is 50 times its aperture in inches (or twice its aperture in millimeters). Asterism Any prominent star pattern that isn't a whole constellation, such as the Northern Cross or the Big Dipper. Asteroid (Minor Planet) A solid body orbiting the Sun that consists of metal and rock. Most are only a few miles in diameter and are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, too small and far away to be seen easily in a small telescope. A few venture closer to the Sun and cross Earth's orbit. Astronomical Unit The average distance from Earth to the Sun, slightly less than 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). Averted Vision Viewing an object by looking slightly to its side. This technique can help you detect faint objects that are invisible when you stare directly at them. Baily's Beads A few "beads" of sunlight, shining between mountain peaks and through the valleys along the Moon's edge in the moment before totality. Barlow Lens A lens that's placed into the focusing tube to effectively double or triple a telescope's focal length and, in turn, the magnification of any eyepiece used with it. Black Hole A concentration of mass so dense that nothing — not even light — can escape its gravitational pull once swallowed up. Blue Moon Traditionally, something that happens rarely or never. Many galaxies (including ours) have supermassive black holes at their centers. More recently, this has come to mean the second full Moon in a single calendar month. Celestial Coordinates A grid system for locating things in the sky. It's anchored to the celestial poles (directly above Earth's north and south poles) and the celestial equator (directly above Earth's equator). Declination and right ascension are the celestial equivalents of latitude and longitude. Circumpolar Denotes an object near a celestial pole that never dips below the horizon as Earth rotates and thus does not rise or set. Collimation Aligning the optical elements of a telescope so that they all point in the proper direction. Most reflectors and compound telescopes require occasional collimation in order to produce the best possible images. Comet A comet is a "dirty snowball" of ice and rocky debris, typically a few miles across, that orbits the Sun in a long ellipse. When close to the Sun, the warmth evaporates the ice in the nucleus to form a coma (cloud of gas) and a tail. Named for their discoverers, comets sometimes make return visits after as little as a few years or as long as tens of thousands of years. Compound Telescope A telescope with a mirror in the back and a lens in the front. The most popular designs are the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) and the Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope (commonly called a "Mak"). Conjunction When the Moon or a planet appears especially close either to another planet or to a bright star. Constellation A distinctive pattern of stars used informally to organize a part of the sky. There are 88 official constellations, which technically define sections of the sky rather than collections of specific stars. Culmination The moment when a celestial object crosses the meridian and is thus at its highest above the horizon. Dark Adaptation The eyes' transition to night vision, in order to see faint objects. Dark adaptation is rapid during the first 5 or 10 minutes after you leave a well-lit room, but full adaptation requires at least a half hour — and it can be ruined by a momentary glance at a bright light. Declination (Dec.) The celestial equivalent of latitude, denoting how far (in degrees) an object in the sky lies north or south of the celestial equator. Dobsonian ("Dob") A type of Newtonian reflector, made popular by amateur astronomer John Dobson, that uses a simple but highly effective wooden mount. Dobs provide more aperture per dollar than any other telescope design. Double Star (Binary Star) Two stars that lie very close to, and are often orbiting, each other. Line-of-sight doubles are a consequence of perspective and aren't physically related. Many stars are multiples (doubles, triples, or more) gravitationally bound together. Usually such stars orbit so closely that they appear as a single point of light even when viewed through professional telescopes. Earthshine Sunlight reflected by Earth that makes the otherwise dark part of the Moon glow faintly. It's especially obvious during the Moon's thin crescent phases. Eccentricity The measure of how much an orbit deviates from being circular. Eclipse An event that occurs when the shadow of a planet or moon falls upon a second body. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's shadow falls upon Earth, which we see as the Moon blocking the Sun. When Earth's shadow falls upon the Moon, it causes a lunar eclipse. Ecliptic The path among the stars traced by the Sun throughout the year. The Moon and planets never stray far from the ecliptic. Elongation The angular distance the Moon or a planet is from the Sun. The inner planets of Mercury and Venus are best seen when at maximum elongation, and thus are highest above the horizon before sunrise or after sunset. Ephemeris A timetable with celestial coordinates that indicates where a planet, comet, or other body moving in relation to background stars will be in the sky. Its plural is ephemerides (pronounced eff-uh-MEHR-ih-deez). Equinox The two times each year, near March 20th and September 22nd, when the Sun is directly overhead at noon as seen from Earth's equator. On an equinox date, day and night are of equal length. Eyepiece The part of a telescope that you look into. A telescope's magnification can be changed by using eyepieces with different focal lengths; shorter focal lengths yield higher magnifications. Most eyepieces have metal barrels that are 1¼ inches in diameter; other standard sizes are 0.965 and 2 inches across. Field of View The circle of sky that you see when you look through a telescope or binoculars. Generally, the lower the magnification, the wider the field of view. Finderscope A small telescope used to aim your main scope at an object in the sky. Finderscopes have low magnifications, wide fields of view, and (usually) crosshairs marking the center of the field. Focal Length The distance (usually expressed in millimeters) from a mirror or lens to the image that it forms. In most telescopes the focal length is roughly equal to the length of the tube. Some telescopes use extra lenses and/or mirrors to create a long effective focal length in a short tube. Focal Ratio (f/number) A lens or mirror's focal length divided by its aperture. For instance, a telescope with an 80-mm-wide lens and a 400-mm focal length has a focal ratio of f/5. Galaxy A vast collection of stars, gas, and dust, typically 10,000 to 100,000 light-years in diameter and containing billions of stars (from galaxias kuklos, Greek for "circle of milk," originally used to describe our own Milky Way). Gibbous When the Moon or other body appears more than half, but not fully, illuminated (from gibbus, Latin for "hump"). Histogram A plot of the number of pixels in an image at each brightness level. It's a useful tool for determining the optimum exposure time; the histogram of a properly exposed image generally peaks near the middle of the available brightness range and falls to zero before reaching either end. Libration A slight tipping and tilting of the Moon from week to week that brings various features along the limb into better view. The main causes are two aspects of the Moon's orbit: its elliptical shape and inclination to the ecliptic. Light Pollution A glow in the night sky or around your observing site caused by artificial light. Special light-pollution filters can be used with your telescope to improve the visibility of celestial objects. Light-year The distance that light (moving at about 186,000 miles per second) travels in one year, or about 6 trillion miles. Limb The edge of a celestial object's visible disk. Magnification (power) The amount that a telescope enlarges its subject. It's equal to the telescope's focal length divided by the eyepiece's focal length. Magnitude A number denoting the brightness of a star or other celestial object. For example, a 1st-magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 6th-magnitude star. Meridian The imaginary north-south line that passes directly overhead (through the zenith). Messier object An entry in a catalog of 103 star clusters, nebulas, and galaxies compiled by French comet hunter Charles Messier (mess-YAY) between 17. The modern-day Messier catalog contains 109 objects. Meteor A brief streak of light caused by a small piece of solid matter entering Earth's atmosphere at tremendous speed (typically 20 to 40 miles per second). Also called a "shooting star." If material survives the trip through the atmosphere, it's called a meteorite after landing on Earth's surface. Meteor Shower An increase in meteor activity at certain times of the year due to Earth passing through a stream of particles along a comet's orbit around the Sun. Milky Way A broad, faintly glowing band stretching across the night sky, composed of billions of stars in our galaxy too faint to be seen individually. It's invisible when the sky is lit up by artificial light or bright moonlight. Mount The device that supports your telescope, allows it to point to different parts of the sky, and lets you track objects as Earth rotates. A sturdy, vibration-free mount is every bit as important as the telescope's optics. A mount's top, or head, can be either alt-azimuth (turning side to side, up and down) or equatorial (turning parallel to the celestial coordinate system). "Go To" mounts contain computers that can find and track celestial objects automatically once the mounts have been aligned properly. Nebula Latin for "cloud." Bright nebulas are great clouds of glowing gas, lit up by stars inside or nearby. Dark nebulas are not lit up and are visible only because they block the light of stars behind them. Objective A telescope's main light-gathering lens or mirror. Occultation When the Moon or a planet passes directly in front of a more distant planet or star. A grazing occultation occurs if the background body is never completely hidden from the observer. Opposition When a planet or asteroid is opposite the Sun in the sky. At such times the object is visible all night — rising at sunset and setting at sunrise. Parallax The apparent offset of a foreground object against the background when your perspective changes. At a given instant, the Moon appears among different stars for observers at widely separated locations on Earth. Astronomers directly calculate the distance to a nearby star by measuring its incredibly small positional changes (its parallax) as Earth orbits the Sun. Phase The fraction of the Moon or other body that we see illuminated by sunlight. Planisphere (Star Wheel) A device that can be adjusted to show the appearance of the night sky for any time and date on a round star map. Planispheres can be used to identify stars and constellations but not the planets, whose positions are always changing. R Reflector A telescope that gathers light with a mirror. The Newtonian reflector, designed by Isaac Newton, has a small second mirror mounted diagonally near the front of the tube to divert the light sideways and out to your eye. Refractor A telescope that gathers light with a lens. The original design showed dramatic rainbows, or "false color," around stars and planets. Most modern refractors are achromatic, meaning "free of false color," but this design still shows thin violet fringes around the brightest objects. The finest refractors produced today are apochromatic, meaning "beyond achromatic." They use expensive, exotic kinds of glass to reduce false color to nearly undetectable levels. Retrograde When an object moves in the reverse sense of "normal" motion. For example, most bodies in the solar system revolve around the Sun and rotate counterclockwise as seen from above (north of) Earth's orbit; those that orbit or spin clockwise have retrograde motion. This term also describes the period when a planet or asteroid appears to backtrack in the sky because of the changing viewing perspective caused by Earth's orbital motion. A.) The celestial equivalent of longitude, denoting how far (in 15°-wide "hours") an object lies east of the Sun's location during the March equinox. Poor seeing makes objects waver or blur when viewed in a telescope at high magnification. The best seeing often occurs on hazy nights, when the sky's transparency is poor. Solar Filter Material that allows safe viewing of the Sun by blocking nearly all of its light. Proper filters should completely cover the front aperture of a telescope and should never be attached to the eyepiece; they range from glass used by welders to special plastic film. White-light filters will show sunspots, while hydrogen-alpha (Hα) filters let certain red light through that reveals the Sun's streaming hot gases. Solstice The two times each year, around June 20th and December 21st, when the Sun is farthest north or south in the sky. At the summer solstice, the day is longest and the night is shortest, and vice versa at the winter solstice. Star A massive ball of gas that generates prodigious amounts of energy (including light) from nuclear fusion in its hot, dense core. Star Cluster A collection of stars orbiting a common center of mass. Open clusters typically contain a few hundred stars and may be only 100 million years old or even less. Globular clusters may contain up to a million stars, and most are at least 10 billion years old (almost as old as the universe itself). Star Diagonal A mirror or prism in an elbow-shaped housing that attaches to the focuser of a refractor or compound telescope. It lets you look horizontally into the eyepiece when the telescope is pointed directly overhead. Star Party A group of people who get together to view the night sky. Astronomy clubs often hold star parties to introduce stargazing to the public. Sunspot A temporary dark blemish on the surface of the Sun that is a planet-size region of gas cooler than its surroundings. Sunspots can be viewed safely using a solar filter. Supernova A star ending its life in a huge explosion. In comparison, a nova is a star that explosively sheds its outer layers without destroying itself. Terminator The line on the Moon or a planet that divides the bright, sunlit part from the part in shadow. It's usually the most exciting and detailed region of the Moon to view through a telescope. Transit When Mercury or Venus crosses the disk of the Sun, making the planet visible as a black dot in silhouette, or when a moon passes across the face of its parent planet. Transit also refers to the instant when a celestial object crosses the meridian and thus is highest in the sky. Transparency A measure of the atmosphere's clarity — how dark the sky is at night and how blue it is during the day. Yet crystal-clear nights with superb transparency often have poor seeing. Twilight The time after sunset or before sunrise when the sky is not fully dark. Astronomical twilight ends after sunset (and begins before sunrise) when the Sun is 18° below the horizon. Unit-Power Finder A device for aiming your telescope that shows the sky as it appears to your unaided eye, without magnification. The simplest type is a pair of notches or circles that you line up with your target. Astronomers use Universal Time to describe when celestial events happen in a way that is independent of an observer's time zone. Other versions use an LED to project a red dot or circle onto a viewing window. Waning The changing illumination of the Moon (or other body) over time. Universal Time (UT) Greenwich Mean Time, expressed in the 24-hour system. The Moon waxes, growing more illuminated, between its new and full phases, and wanes, becoming less illuminated, between its full and new phases. Waxing The changing illumination of the Moon (or other body) over time. The Moon waxes, growing more illuminated, between its new and full phases, and wanes, becoming less illuminated, between its full and new phases. Zenith The point in the sky that's directly overhead. Zodiac Greek for "circle of animals." It's the set of constellations situated along the ecliptic in the sky, through which the Sun, Moon, and planets move.ISBN:
The musica universalis (literally universal music), also called music of the spheres or harmony of the spheres, is an ancient philosophical concept that regards proportions in the movements of celestial bodies—the Sun, Moon, and planets—as a form of music. This "music" is not thought to be audible, but rather a harmonic, mathematical or religious concept. The idea continued to appeal to scholars until the end of the Renaissance, influencing many kinds of scholars, including humanists. Further scientific exploration discovered orbital resonance in specific proportions in some orbital motion. The discovery of the precise relation between the pitch of the musical note and the length of the string that produces it is attributed to Pythagoras. The Music of the Spheres incorporates the metaphysical principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or "tones" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. Pythagoras first identified that the pitch of a musical note is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios. From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the force of its action must be immense. and this intriguing connection between music and astronomy stimulated the imagination of Johannes Kepler as he devoted much of his time after publishing the Mysterium Cosmographicum (Mystery of the Cosmos) looking over tables and trying to fit the data to what he believed to be the true nature of the cosmos as it relates to musical sound. In 1619 Kepler published Harmonices Mundi (literally Harmony of the Worlds), expanding on the concepts he introduced in Mysterium and positing that musical intervals and harmonies describe the motions of the six known planets of the time. He believed that this harmony, while inaudible, could be heard by the soul, and that it gave a "very agreeable feeling of bliss, afforded him by this music in the imitation of God." In Harmonices, Kepler who differed from Pythagorean observations, laid out an argument for a christian-centric creator who had made an explicit connection between geometry, astronomy, and music, and that the planets were arranged intelligently. The first and second books give a brief discussion on regular polyhedron and their congruences, reiterating the idea he introduced in Mysterium that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including consonance and dissonance, intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length which was a discovery made by Pythagoras, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to in his opinion. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for heliocentrism. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on astrology in book five, Kepler ends Harmonices by describing his third law, which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period. In the final book of Harmonices, Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum angular speeds of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies. While Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of Harmonices. He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between monophonic and polyphonic music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more "notes." Earth's maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus' orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mercury, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the Solar System was composed of two basses (Saturn and Jupiter), a tenor (Mars), two altos (Venus and Earth), and a soprano (Mercury), which had sung in "perfect concord," at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again. He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that "man, the imitator of the Creator," had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy "the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour." Kepler was so convinced in a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in Harmonices. Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars' and Jupiter's angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these elliptical paths had to fit into the regular solids described in Mysterium the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect. Kepler was convinced "that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world" and wanted to further explore the aspects of the natural world specifically being involved with astronomical and astrological concepts of music. When Kepler published Harmonices Mundi, Kepler was held liable in a dispute with Robert Fludd, who also published his own harmonic theory at the time. To Kepler, the celestial physics of the spheres were seen as geometrically spatial regions that consisted of each planetary orbit rather than its physical form. For there is a musicke where-ever there is a harmony, order or proportion; and thus farre we may maintain the musick of the spheres; for those well ordered motions, and regular paces, though they give no sound unto the eare, yet to the understanding they strike a note most full of harmony. Whatsoever is harmonically composed, delights in harmony. The connection between music, mathematics, and astronomy had a profound impact on history. It resulted in music's inclusion in the Quadrivium, the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, and along with the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) made up the seven liberal arts, which are still the basis for higher education today. A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Musica Universalis or Harmony of the Spheres. Among these are Music of the Spheres by Mike Oldfield, Om by the Moody Blues, The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi album by The Receiving End of Sirens, Music of the Spheres by Ian Brown, and Björk's single Cosmogony, included in her 2011 album Biophilia. Earlier, in the 1910s, Danish composer Rued Langgaard composed a pioneering orchestral work titled Music of the Spheres. Music of the Spheres was also the title chosen for the musical foundation of the video-game Destiny, and was composed by Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul Mc Cartney. Paul Hindemith wrote an Opera (1957), and a Symphony using the same music, called 'Die Harmonie der Welt' based upon the life of the Astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630). On November 22, 2019, Coldplay released their eighth studio album, Everyday Life. In one of the pages of the CD liner notes is an image of a billboard with the phrase "Music of the Spheres" written in large text and the words "Coldplay coming soon" in smaller text. In addition, next to the billboard is a Rover car with the license plate "FFTF2024". When asked about the image in an interview with Virgin Radio France, lead singer Chris Martin responded by saying that the phrase "definitely means something". In 2018, Coldplay trademarked the phrase "Music of the Spheres" in connection with their Global Citizen-curated EP under the pseudonym "Los Unidades".
In the case of celestial motion, mayl is neither the motion itself nor the motive power, but an intermediary stage in the realization of motion, which combines with the psychological activity of the celestial bodies and enables the transmission of the motive powers to the corporeal part of the orbs; see Mabdaʾ, p. 54.

One similarity that exists between astrology and astronomy is the way in which they originated. Astronomy originated in the ancient world when people began to notice that heavenly bodies moved in a specific, consistent motion. The more people understood about the movement of the heavenly bodies, the easier it was for people to keep track of time.

The formation of various bodies from these particles arises from four forces the general motion of celestial globules, gravity, light, and heat. Descartes' discussion of gravity, or the "second force," is generally the only section translated into English from the first two thirds of Part IV.Celestial bodies are made from the least dense material. Atomistic theory, which was pursued by Epicurus and Lucretius, was completely overshadowed by Aristotelianism but revived in the 17th century, particularly by the French philosopher Pierre Gassendi, and has become the basis of modern physics, even though our ideas about atoms are quite.Apr 27, 2014 One of the first to theorize the motion of both terrestrial and celestial bodies was Aristotle around 330BCE. To this philosopher, the universe had always been eternally geocentric. On Earth the concept of motion was, not only linear but, relatable to the material that was in motion.

When we look at the sky, we see different kinds of natural bodies like the sun, the stars, the moon, and so on. The natural bodies in the sky are called celestial bodies or heavenly bodies. They are part of our universe. The universe isCelestial Bodies 1. COMETS • Are bodies of small mass that revolve around the sun, usually in highly elliptical orbits and consisting of the dirty snowball model of small solid particles embedded in frozen gases. • 1682, Astronomer Edmund Halley • Studied the written accounts of 24 comets.The dividing line between the two was the orbit of the moon. While the earth was a place of transition and flux, the heavens were unchanging. Aristotle posited that there was a fifth substance, the quintessence, that was what the heavens were made of, and that the heavens were a place of perfect spherical motion.
